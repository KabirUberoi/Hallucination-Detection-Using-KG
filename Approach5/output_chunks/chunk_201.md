[Marcel Danesi](/wiki/Marcel\_Danesi "Marcel Danesi") suggests that people who
believe conspiracy theories have difficulty rethinking situations. Exposure to
those theories has caused neural pathways which are more rigid and less
subject to change. Initial susceptibility to believing the lies, dehumanizing
language, and metaphors of these theories leads to the acceptance of larger
and more extensive theories because the hardened neural pathways are already
present. Repetition of the "facts" of conspiracy theories and their connected
lies simply reinforces the rigidity of those pathways. Thus, conspiracy
theories and dehumanizing lies are not mere hyperbole, they can actually
change the way people think:

> Unfortunately, research into this brain wiring also shows that once people
> begin to believe lies, they are unlikely to change their minds even when
> confronted with evidence that contradicts their beliefs. It is a form of
> brainwashing. Once the brain has carved out a well-worn path of believing
> deceit, it is even harder to step out of that path â€” which is how fanatics
> are born. Instead, these people will seek out information that confirms
> their beliefs, avoid anything that is in conflict with them, or even turn
> the contrasting information on its head, so as to make it fit their beliefs.

> People with strong convictions will have a hard time changing their minds,
> given how embedded a lie becomes in the mind. In fact, there are scientists
> and scholars still studying the best tools and tricks to combat lies with
> some combination of brain training and linguistic awareness.[139]
