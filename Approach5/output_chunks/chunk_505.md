##### Time-squared
law[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galileo\_Galilei&action=edit&section=33 "Edit
section: Time-squared law")]

Galileo proposed that a falling body would fall with a uniform acceleration,
as long as the resistance of the medium through which it was falling remained
negligible, or in the limiting case of its falling through a vacuum.[213][214]
He also derived the correct kinematical law for the distance travelled during
a uniform acceleration starting from rest—namely, that it is proportional to
the square of the elapsed time (\_d\_ ∝ \_t\_ 2).[205][215] Galileo expressed the
time-squared law using geometrical constructions and mathematically precise
words, adhering to the standards of the day. (It remained for others to re-
express the law in algebraic terms.)[\_[citation
