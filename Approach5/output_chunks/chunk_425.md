Physics as understood pre-1900

major domains of modern physics

\*\*Classical physics\*\* is a group of [physics](/wiki/Physics "Physics")
theories that predate modern, more complete, or more widely applicable
theories. If a currently accepted theory is considered to be modern, and its
introduction represented a major [paradigm shift](/wiki/Paradigm\_shift
"Paradigm shift"), then the previous theories, or new theories based on the
older paradigm, will often be referred to as belonging to the area of
"classical physics".

As such, the definition of a classical theory depends on context. Classical
physical concepts are often used when modern theories are unnecessarily
complex for a particular situation. Most often, \_classical physics\_ refers to
pre-1900 physics, while \_[modern physics](/wiki/Modern\_physics "Modern
physics")\_ refers to post-1900 physics, which incorporates elements of
[quantum mechanics](/wiki/Quantum\_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") and
[relativity](/wiki/Theory\_of\_relativity "Theory of relativity").[1]
