Pennsylvania House of Representatives election")

Simone is running as a [Republican](/wiki/Republican\_Party\_\(US\) "Republican
Party \(US\)") for the [150th
District](/wiki/Pennsylvania\_House\_of\_Representatives,\_District\_150
"Pennsylvania House of Representatives, District 150") in the [Pennsylvania
House of Representatives](/wiki/Pennsylvania\_House\_of\_Representatives
"Pennsylvania House of Representatives") elections in 2024. Her platform
contains elements of the couple's pronatalist philosophy. Simone says she
intends to combat policies she sees as negatively impacting the ability to
raise a family, citing the example of required car seats preventing more
children from occupying a vehicle. She also supports [school
choice](/wiki/School\_choice "School choice"), lowering taxes, and government
implementation of [artificial intelligence](/wiki/Artificial\_intelligence
"Artificial intelligence"). Simone has criticized
[progressive](/wiki/Progressivism\_in\_the\_United\_States "Progressivism in the
United States") policies, such as the renaming of schools with offensive
names, as being unnecessary and further ruining her former hometown in
[California](/wiki/California "California")'s [Bay
Area](/wiki/San\_Francisco\_Bay\_Area "San Francisco Bay Area"). She has said she
opposes "bureaucratic bloat and ossification."

The Collinses do not support [transgender health
care](/wiki/Transgender\_health\_care "Transgender health care") for youth, but
express acceptance for people whom Simone described as "legit trans" as
opposed to those who fall into the "trans cult." Simone opposes allowing
transgender students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity
and to play on sports teams matching their gender identity.[27]
