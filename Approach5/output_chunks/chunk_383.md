al-Haytham") (c. 965–1040).

In the 7th to 15th centuries, scientific progress occurred in the Muslim
world. Many classic works in [Indian](/wiki/India "India"),
[Assyrian](/wiki/Assyria "Assyria"), [Sassanian (Persian)](/wiki/Sassanian
"Sassanian") and [Greek](/wiki/Greece "Greece"), including the works of
Aristotle, were translated into [Arabic](/wiki/Arabic "Arabic").[9] Important
contributions were made by [Ibn al-Haytham](/wiki/Ibn\_al-Haytham "Ibn al-
Haytham") (965–1040), an [Arab](/wiki/Arab "Arab")[10] or
[Persian](/wiki/Persians "Persians")[11] scientist, considered to be a founder
of modern [optics](/wiki/Optics "Optics"). Ptolemy and Aristotle theorised
that light either shone from the eye to illuminate objects or that "forms"
emanated from objects themselves, whereas al-Haytham (known by the Latin name
"Alhazen") suggested that light travels to the eye in rays from different
points on an object. The works of Ibn al-Haytham and [al-Biruni](/wiki/Al-
Biruni "Al-Biruni") (973–1050), a Persian scientist, eventually passed on to
Western Europe where they were studied by scholars such as [Roger
Bacon](/wiki/Roger\_Bacon "Roger Bacon") and [Vitello](/wiki/Vitello
"Vitello").[12]

Ibn al-Haytham used controlled experiments in his work on optics, although to
what extent it differed from Ptolemy is up to debate.[13][14] Arabic mechanics
like Bīrūnī and [Al-Khazini](/wiki/Al-Khazini "Al-Khazini") developed
sophisticated "science of weight", carrying out measurements of specific
weights and volumes[15]

[Ibn Sīnā](/wiki/Avicenna "Avicenna") (980–1037), known as "Avicenna", was a
polymath from [Bukhara](/wiki/Bukhara "Bukhara") (in present-day
[Uzbekistan](/wiki/Uzbekistan "Uzbekistan")) responsible for important
contributions to physics, optics, philosophy and [medicine](/wiki/Medicine
"Medicine"). He published his theory of [motion](/wiki/Motion\_\(physics\)
"Motion \(physics\)") in \_[Book of Healing](/wiki/Book\_of\_Healing "Book of
Healing")\_ (1020), where he argued that an impetus is imparted to a projectile
by the thrower. He viewed it as persistent, requiring external forces such as
[air resistance](/wiki/Air\_resistance "Air resistance") to dissipate
it.[16][17][18] Ibn Sina made a distinction between 'force' and 'inclination'
(called "mayl"), and argued that an object gained mayl when the object is in
opposition to its natural motion. He concluded that continuation of motion is
attributed to the inclination that is transferred to the object, and that
object will be in motion until the mayl is spent. This conception of motion is
consistent with [Newton's first law of
motion](/wiki/Newton%27s\_first\_law\_of\_motion "Newton's first law of motion"),
[inertia](/wiki/Inertia "Inertia"), which states that an object in motion will
stay in motion unless it is acted on by an external force.[16] This idea which
dissented from the Aristotelian view was later described as
"[impetus](/wiki/Theory\_of\_impetus "Theory of impetus")" by [John
Buridan](/wiki/John\_Buridan "John Buridan"), who was likely influenced by Ibn
Sina's \_Book of Healing\_.[19]

\_[Algebra](/wiki/The\_Compendious\_Book\_on\_Calculation\_by\_Completion\_and\_Balancing

[Hibat Allah Abu'l-Barakat al-Baghdaadi](/wiki/Hibat\_Allah\_Abu%27l-Barakat\_al-
Baghdaadi "Hibat Allah Abu'l-Barakat al-Baghdaadi") (c. 1080 – c. 1165)
adopted and modified Ibn Sina's theory on [projectile
motion](/wiki/Projectile\_motion "Projectile motion"). In his \_Kitab al-
Mu'tabar\_ , Abu'l-Barakat stated that the mover imparts a violent inclination
(\_mayl qasri\_) on the moved and that this diminishes as the moving object
distances itself from the mover.[20] He also proposed an explanation of the
[acceleration](/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration") of falling bodies by the
accumulation of successive increments of [power](/wiki/Power\_\(physics\)
"Power \(physics\)") with successive increments of [velocity](/wiki/Velocity
"Velocity").[21] According to [Shlomo Pines](/wiki/Shlomo\_Pines "Shlomo
Pines"), al-Baghdaadi's theory of motion was "the oldest negation of
Aristotle's fundamental dynamic law [namely, that a constant force produces a
uniform motion], [and is thus an] anticipation in a vague fashion of the
fundamental law of [classical mechanics](/wiki/Classical\_mechanics "Classical
mechanics") [namely, that a force applied continuously produces
acceleration]."[22] Jean Buridan and [Albert of
Saxony](/wiki/Albert\_of\_Saxony\_\(philosopher\) "Albert of Saxony
\(philosopher\)") later referred to Abu'l-Barakat in explaining that the
acceleration of a falling body is a result of its increasing impetus.[20]

[Ibn Bajjah](/wiki/Ibn\_Bajjah "Ibn Bajjah") (c. 1085 – 1138), known as
"Avempace" in Europe, proposed that for every force there is always a
[reaction](/wiki/Reaction\_\(physics\) "Reaction \(physics\)") force. Ibn
Bajjah was a critic of Ptolemy and he worked on creating a new theory of
velocity to replace the one theorized by Aristotle. Two future philosophers
supported the theories Avempace created, known as Avempacean dynamics. These
philosophers were [Thomas Aquinas](/wiki/Thomas\_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas"), a
Catholic priest, and [John Duns Scotus](/wiki/Duns\_Scotus "Duns Scotus").[23]
[Galileo](/wiki/Galileo\_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") went on to adopt Avempace's
formula "that the velocity of a given object is the difference of the motive
power of that object and the resistance of the medium of motion".[23]

[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi](/wiki/Nasir\_al-Din\_al-Tusi "Nasir al-Din al-Tusi")
(1201–1274), a Persian astronomer and mathematician who died in Baghdad
introduced the [Tusi couple](/wiki/Tusi\_couple "Tusi couple"). Copernicus
later drew heavily on the work of al-Din al-Tusi and his students, but without
acknowledgment.[24]
