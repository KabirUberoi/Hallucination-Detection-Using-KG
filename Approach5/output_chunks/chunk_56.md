"Edit section: UK distribution and ratings")]

The show made its United Kingdom debut on [Channel 4](/wiki/Channel\_4 "Channel
4") on February 14, 2008. The show was also shown as a 'first-look' on Channel
4's digital offshoot [E4](/wiki/E4\_\(TV\_channel\) "E4 \(TV channel\)") prior
to the main channel's airing. While the show's ratings were not deemed strong
enough to warrant broadcast on the main channel, they were considered the
opposite for E4. For each following season, all episodes were shown first-run
on E4, with episodes only aired on the main channel in a repeat capacity,
usually on a weekend morning. From the third season, the show aired in two
parts, being split so that it could air new episodes for longer throughout the
year. This was due to rising ratings. The first part began airing on December
17, 2009, at 9:00 p.m. while the second part, containing the remaining eleven
episodes, began airing in the same time period from May 6, 2010. The first
half of the fourth season began airing on November 4, 2010, at 9:00 p.m.,
drawing 877,000 viewers, with a further 256,000 watching on the E4+1 hour
service. This gave the show an overall total of 1.13 million viewers, making
it E4's most-watched programme for that week. The increased ratings continued
over subsequent weeks.[208]

The fourth season's second half began on June 30, 2011. Season 5 began airing
on November 3, 2011, at 8:00 p.m. as part of E4's Comedy Thursdays, acting as
a lead-in to the channel's newest comedy, \_[Perfect
Couples](/wiki/Perfect\_Couples "Perfect Couples")\_. Episode 19, the highest-
viewed episode of the season, attracted 1.4 million viewers.[209] Season 6
premiered on November 15, 2012, with 1.89 million viewers and a further
469,000 on the time shift channel, bringing the total to 2.31 million, E4's
highest viewing ratings of 2012, and the highest the channel had received
since June 2011. The sixth season returned in mid-2013 to finish airing the
remaining episodes.[210] Season 7 premiered on E4 on October 31, 2013, at 8:30
pm and hit multiple ratings records this season. The second half of season
seven aired in mid 2014.[211] The eighth season premiered on E4 on October 23,
2014, at 8:30 pm.[212] During its eighth season, \_The Big Bang Theory\_ shared
its 8:30 pm time period with fellow CBS comedy, \_[2 Broke
Girls](/wiki/2\_Broke\_Girls "2 Broke Girls")\_. Following the airing of the
first eight episodes of that show's fourth season, \_The Big Bang Theory\_
returned to finish airing its eighth season on March 19, 2015.[213]

[Netflix UK & Ireland](/wiki/Netflix "Netflix") announced on February 13,
2016, that seasons 1â€“8 would be available to stream from February 15,
2016.[214]
