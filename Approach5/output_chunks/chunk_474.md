### Name[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galileo\_Galilei&action=edit&section=2 "Edit
section: Name")]

Galileo tended to refer to himself only by his given name. At the time,
surnames were optional in Italy, and his given name had the same origin as his
sometimes-family name, Galilei. Both his given and family name ultimately
derive from an ancestor, [Galileo Bonaiuti](/wiki/Galileo\_Bonaiuti "Galileo
Bonaiuti"), an important physician, professor, and politician in Florence in
the 15th century.[21] Galileo Bonaiuti was buried in the same church, the
[Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence](/wiki/Basilica\_of\_Santa\_Croce,\_Florence
"Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence"), where about 200 years later, Galileo
Galilei was also buried.[22]

When he did refer to himself with more than one name, it was sometimes as
Galileo Galilei Linceo, a reference to his being a member of the [Accademia
dei Lincei](/wiki/Accademia\_dei\_Lincei "Accademia dei Lincei"), an elite pro-
science organization in Italy. It was common for mid-sixteenth-century Tuscan
families to name the eldest son after the parents' surname.[23] Hence, Galileo
Galilei was not necessarily named after his ancestor Galileo Bonaiuti. The
Italian male given name "Galileo" (and thence the surname "Galilei") derives
from the Latin "Galilaeus", meaning "of [Galilee](/wiki/Galilee "Galilee")", a
biblically significant region in Northern [Israel](/wiki/Israel
"Israel").[24][21] Because of that region, the adjective \_galilaios\_
([Greek](/wiki/Greek\_language "Greek language") Γαλιλαῖος, [Latin](/wiki/Latin
"Latin") \_Galilaeus\_ , [Italian](/wiki/Italian\_language "Italian language")
\_Galileo\_), which means "Galilean", was used in antiquity (particularly by
[emperor Julian](/wiki/Emperor\_Julian "Emperor Julian")) to refer to
[Christ](/wiki/Christ "Christ") and [his followers](/wiki/Christianity
"Christianity").[25]

The biblical roots of Galileo's name and surname were to become the subject of
a famous pun.[26] In 1614, during the [Galileo affair](/wiki/Galileo\_affair
"Galileo affair"), one of Galileo's opponents, the Dominican priest [Tommaso
Caccini](/wiki/Tommaso\_Caccini "Tommaso Caccini"), delivered against Galileo a
controversial and influential
[sermon](/wiki/Tommaso\_Caccini#Sermon\_at\_Santa\_Maria\_Novella "Tommaso
Caccini"). In it he made a point of quoting [Acts](/wiki/Acts\_of\_the\_Apostles
"Acts of the Apostles")
[1:11](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible\_\(King\_James\)/Acts#1:11 "s:Bible
\(King James\)/Acts"), "Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into
heaven?" (in the [Latin](/wiki/Latin "Latin") version found in the
[Vulgate](/wiki/Vulgate "Vulgate"): \_Viri Galilaei, quid statis aspicientes in
caelum?\_).[27]
