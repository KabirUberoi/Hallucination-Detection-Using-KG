## Theory
X[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Theory\_X\_and\_Theory\_Y&action=edit&section=2 "Edit
section: Theory X")]

Theory X is based on negative assumptions regarding the typical worker. This
management style assumes that the typical worker has little ambition, avoids
responsibility, and is individual-goal oriented. In general, Theory X style
managers believe their employees are less intelligent, lazier, and work solely
for a sustainable income. Management believes employees' work is based on
their own self-interest.[6] Managers who believe employees operate in this
manner are more likely to use [rewards or
punishments](/wiki/Transactional\_leadership "Transactional leadership") as
motivation.[6] Due to these assumptions, Theory X concludes the typical
[workforce](/wiki/Workforce "Workforce") operates more
[efficiently](/wiki/Efficiency\_\(economics\) "Efficiency \(economics\)") under
a hands-on approach to management. Theory X managers believe all actions
should be traceable to the individual responsible. This allows the individual
to receive either a direct reward or a reprimand, depending on the outcome's
positive or negative nature. This [managerial style](/wiki/Managerial\_style
"Managerial style") is more effective when used in a workforce that is not
essentially motivated to perform.

According to McGregor, there are two opposing approaches to implementing
Theory X: the hard approach and the soft approach.[7] The hard approach
depends on close supervision, intimidation, and immediate punishment.[8] This
approach can potentially yield a hostile, minimally cooperative workforce and
resentment towards management.[6] Managers are always looking for mistakes
from employees, because they do not trust their work.[6] Theory X is a "we
versus they" approach, meaning it is the management versus the employees.[6]

The soft approach is characterized by leniency and less strict rules in hopes
for creating high [workplace morale](/wiki/Employee\_morale "Employee morale")
and cooperative employees.[7] Implementing a system that is too soft could
result in an entitled, low-output workforce.[7] McGregor believes both ends of
the spectrum are too extreme for efficient real-world application. Instead,
McGregor feels that an approach located in the middle would be the most
effective implementation of Theory X.[7]

Because managers and supervisors are in almost complete control of the work,
this produces a more systematic and uniform product or work flow. Theory X can
benefit a work place that utilizes an assembly line or manual labor. Using
this theory in these types of work conditions allows employees to specialize
in particular work areas which in turn allows the company to mass-produce a
higher quantity and [quality of work](/wiki/Product\_quality "Product
quality").
