The term "conspiracy theory" is itself the subject of a conspiracy theory,
which posits that the term was popularized by the [CIA](/wiki/CIA "CIA") in
order to discredit conspiratorial believers, particularly critics of the
[Warren Commission](/wiki/Warren\_Commission "Warren Commission"), by making
them a target of ridicule.[59] In his 2013 book \_Conspiracy Theory in America\_
, the political scientist Lance deHaven-Smith wrote that the term entered
everyday language in the United States after 1964, the year in which the
Warren Commission published its findings on the [Kennedy
assassination](/wiki/Kennedy\_assassination "Kennedy assassination"), with \_The
New York Times\_ running five stories that year using the term.[60]

Whether the CIA was responsible for popularising the term "conspiracy theory"
was analyzed by Michael Butter, a Professor of American Literary and Cultural
History at the [University of Tübingen](/wiki/University\_of\_T%C3%BCbingen
"University of Tübingen"). Butter wrote in 2020 that the CIA document
\_Concerning Criticism of the Warren Report\_ , which proponents of the theory
use as evidence of CIA motive and intention, does not contain the phrase
"conspiracy theory" in the singular, and only uses the term "conspiracy
theories" once, in the sentence: "Conspiracy theories have frequently thrown
suspicion on our organisation [\_[sic](/wiki/Sic "Sic")\_], for example, by
falsely alleging that Lee Harvey Oswald worked for us."[61]
