Typically, all cassowaries are shy birds that are found in the deep forest.
They are adept at disappearing long before a human knows they are there. The
southern cassowary of the far north [Queensland](/wiki/Queensland
"Queensland") [rain forests](/wiki/Rain\_forest "Rain forest") is not well
studied, and the northern and dwarf cassowaries even less so. Females are
larger and more brightly coloured than the males. Adult southern cassowaries
are 1.5 to 1.8 m (4 ft 11 in to 5 ft 11 in) tall, although some females may
reach 2 m (6 ft 6+1⁄2 in),[25] and weigh 58.5 kg (130 lb).[19] However, it is
not uncommon to see exceptionally large females topping the scales beyond 70
kg (150 lb), with the largest maximum recorded being a [southern
cassowary](/wiki/Southern\_cassowary "Southern cassowary") at 85 kg (187 lb)
and 190 cm (6 ft 3 in) tall.

Hence, by technicality, all three species of cassowaries are considered as
Asia's largest bird since the extinction of the [Arabian
ostrich](/wiki/Arabian\_ostrich "Arabian ostrich"). Moreover, not only is the
cassowary Asia's largest bird, within [New Guinea](/wiki/New\_Guinea "New
Guinea"), the cassowary is the island's second largest terrestrial animal
after the introduction of [Cervidaes](/wiki/Cervidae "Cervidae") such as the
[rusa deer](/wiki/Rusa\_deer "Rusa deer"), [chital](/wiki/Chital "Chital"), and
[fallow deer](/wiki/Fallow\_deer "Fallow deer").[26]

All cassowaries' feathers consist of a shaft and loose barbules. They do not
have [rectrices](/wiki/Rectrices "Rectrices") (tail feathers) or a [preen
gland](/wiki/Uropygial\_gland "Uropygial gland"). Cassowaries have small wings
with five or six large [remiges](/wiki/Remex "Remex"). These are reduced to
stiff, [keratinous](/wiki/Keratin "Keratin") quills, resembling porcupine
quills, with no barbs.[19] The [furcula](/wiki/Furcula "Furcula") and
[coracoid](/wiki/Coracoid "Coracoid") are degenerate, and their
[palatal](/wiki/Palatal "Palatal") bones and [sphenoid](/wiki/Sphenoid\_bone
"Sphenoid bone") bones touch each other.[27] These, along with their wedge-
shaped body, are thought to be adaptations to ward off vines, thorns, and saw-
edged leaves, allowing them to run quickly through the rainforest.[28]

Unlike the majority of birds, cassowaries lack a tongue[29]. Their beaks are
pointed, sharp and robust but not serrated, which allows them to pick up fruit
or small animals much easier than the short bills of an [emu](/wiki/Emu "Emu")
or an [ostrich](/wiki/Ostrich "Ostrich")[29][30].

Cassowaries have three-[toed](/wiki/Toe "Toe") feet with sharp
[claws](/wiki/Claw "Claw"). The inner (first) toe has a [dagger](/wiki/Dagger
"Dagger")-like claw that may be 125 mm (5 in) long.[19] This claw is
particularly fearsome, since cassowaries sometimes kick humans and other
animals with their powerful legs. Cassowaries can run at up to 50 km/h (30
mph) through the dense forest and can jump up to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in). They are
good swimmers, crossing wide rivers and swimming in the sea.[31]

All three species have a keratinous, skin-covered
[casque](/wiki/Casque\_\(anatomy\) "Casque \(anatomy\)") on their heads that
grows with age. The casque's shape and size, up to 18 cm (7 in), is species-
dependent. \_C. casuarius\_ has the largest and \_C. bennetti\_ the smallest
(tricorn shape), with \_C. unappendiculatus\_ having variations in between.
Contrary to earlier findings, the hollow inside of the casque is spanned with
fine fibres.[24]

Several functions for the casque have been proposed. One is that they are a
[secondary sexual characteristic](/wiki/Secondary\_sexual\_characteristic
"Secondary sexual characteristic"). Other suggested functions include batting
through the underbrush, as a weapon in dominance disputes, or pushing aside
leaf litter during foraging.[32] The latter three are disputed by biologist
Andrew Mack, whose personal observation suggests that the casque amplifies
deep sounds.[33] This is related to a discovery that at least the dwarf
cassowary and southern cassowary produce very low-frequency sounds, which may
aid in communication in dense rainforests.[33] The "boom" vocalization that
cassowaries produce is the lowest-frequency bird call known and is at the
lower limit of human hearing.[34] Recent study suggests that casque acts as a
thermal radiator, offloading heat at high temperatures and restricting heat
loss at low temperatures.[35]

The average lifespan of wild cassowaries is approximately 18–20 years, with
those held in captivity living up to 40 years.[36]
