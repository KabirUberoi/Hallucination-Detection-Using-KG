In May 2010, it was reported that the show had been picked up for
[syndication](/wiki/Broadcast\_syndication "Broadcast syndication"), mainly
among [Fox](/wiki/Fox\_Broadcasting\_Company "Fox Broadcasting Company")'s
[owned and operated stations](/wiki/Fox\_Television\_Stations "Fox Television
Stations") and other local stations, with Warner Bros. Television's sister
cable network [TBS](/wiki/TBS\_\(U.S.\_TV\_channel\) "TBS \(U.S. TV channel\)")
holding the show's cable syndication rights. Broadcast of old episodes began
airing in September 2011. TBS now airs the series in primetime on Tuesdays,
Wednesdays, and Thursdays, with evening broadcasts on Saturdays (TBS's former
[local sister station](/wiki/WPCH-TV "WPCH-TV") in [Atlanta](/wiki/Atlanta
"Atlanta") also holds local weeknight rights to the series).[101] Although
details of the syndication deal have not been revealed, it was reported the
deal "set a record price for a cable off-network sitcom purchase".[102] CTV
holds national broadcast syndication rights in Canada, while sister cable
network [The Comedy Network](/wiki/The\_Comedy\_Network "The Comedy Network")
holds cable rights.
