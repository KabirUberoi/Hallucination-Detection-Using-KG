Malcolm is the great-grandson of [Carr Collins Sr.](/wiki/Carr\_Collins\_Sr.
"Carr Collins Sr."), founder of the [Fidelity Union Life Insurance
Company](/wiki/Fidelity\_Union\_Life\_Insurance\_Company "Fidelity Union Life
Insurance Company"), and grandson of [James M. Collins](/wiki/James\_M.\_Collins
"James M. Collins"), a Dallas, Texas businessman and politician.[28] In 1997,
Malcolm's parents undertook a contentious divorce and custody dispute; the
proceedings were characterized by one judge as "extensive, bitter and long-
lasting".[29][30] During the divorce, Malcolm was ordered to live at a private
boarding school funded by a family trust.[30] The divorce was finalized in
2001.[29] It would be discovered in 2021, upon the death James Collins's wife
Dorothy Dann Collins Torbert, that some $29 million had been embezzled from
the family trust fund by Barbara Chalmers, the family bookkeeper.[31][32][33]
Reflecting on his childhood, Malcolm noted that he has "no beef with my
parents. My childhood was hard, but my adulthood has been easy. Can I say a
parent did a bad job if I’m happy with my life today? I don’t think so."[30]

Simone was born in Japan[34] as a self-described "mistake baby" and the only
child to a failed polyamorous marriage.[30] At some point in her life, Simone
experienced eating disorders that gave her fertility issues.[30]
