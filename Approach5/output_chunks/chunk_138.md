Game theory also has an extensive use in a specific branch or stream of
economics â€“ [Managerial Economics](/wiki/Managerial\_economics "Managerial
economics"). One important usage of it in the field of managerial economics is
in analyzing strategic interactions between firms.[109] For example, firms may
be competing in a market with limited resources, and game theory can help
managers understand how their decisions impact their competitors and the
overall market outcomes. Game theory can also be used to analyze cooperation
between firms, such as in forming strategic alliances or joint ventures.
Another use of game theory in managerial economics is in analyzing pricing
strategies. For example, firms may use game theory to determine the optimal
[pricing strategy](/wiki/Pricing\_strategy "Pricing strategy") based on how
they expect their competitors to respond to their pricing decisions. Overall,
game theory serves as a useful tool for analyzing strategic interactions and
decision making in the context of managerial economics.
