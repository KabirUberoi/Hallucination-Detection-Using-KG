Virginity testing drives unequal social pressures for men and women to remain
virgins until they marry. [20] Virginity testing perpetuates these harmful
[stereotyped](/wiki/Stereotype "Stereotype") beliefs through the
discriminatory framework that women are primarily responsible for all sexual
activity and misconduct.[20]

In [Iran](/wiki/Iran "Iran"), sixteen in-depth, semi-structured interviews
were conducted with participants aged 32 to 60 years to elucidate the
perceptions and experiences of Iranian examiners of virginity testing.[20] The
perception and experience of examiners were reflected in five main themes. The
result of this study indicated that virginity testing is more than a medical
examination, considering the cultural factors involved and its overt and
covert consequences. In Iran, testing is performed for both formal and
informal reasons, and examiners view such testing with ambiguity about the
accuracy and certainty of the diagnosis and uncertainty about ethics and
reproductive rights. Examiners are affected by the overt and covert
consequences of virginity testing, beliefs and cultural values underlying
virginity testing, and informal and formal reasons for virginity testing also
used to examine sexual offence.[20]
