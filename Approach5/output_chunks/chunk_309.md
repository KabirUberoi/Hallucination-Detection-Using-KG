\_Mysselhøj\_ , 
a [Nordic Bronze Age](/wiki/Nordic\_Bronze\_Age "Nordic Bronze Age") [burial
mound](/wiki/Burial\_mound "Burial mound") in [Roskilde](/wiki/Roskilde
"Roskilde"), [Denmark](/wiki/Denmark "Denmark")

Continuing as late as the 19th century, [warden trees](/wiki/V%C3%B6r%C3%B0r
"Vörðr") were venerated in areas of Germany and Scandinavia, considered to be
guardians and bringers of luck, and offerings were sometimes made to them. A
massive [birch](/wiki/Birch "Birch") tree standing atop a [burial
mound](/wiki/Tumulus "Tumulus") and located beside a farm in western
[Norway](/wiki/Norway "Norway") is recorded as having had ale poured over its
roots during festivals. The tree was felled in 1874.[27]

Davidson comments that "the position of the tree in the centre as a source of
luck and protection for gods and men is confirmed" by these rituals to Warden
Trees. Davidson notes that the gods are described as meeting beneath Yggdrasil
to hold their [things](/wiki/Thing\_\(assembly\) "Thing \(assembly\)"), and the
related [Irminsul](/wiki/Irminsul "Irminsul"), which may have been a pillar,
was also symbolic of the center of the world. Davidson details that it would
be difficult to ascertain whether a tree or pillar came first, and that this
is likely to depend on whether the holy location was in a thickly wooded area
or not. Davidson notes that there is no mention of a [sacred
tree](/wiki/Sacred\_trees\_and\_groves\_in\_Germanic\_paganism\_and\_mythology "Sacred
trees and groves in Germanic paganism and mythology") at
[Þingvellir](/wiki/%C3%9Eingvellir "Þingvellir") in [Iceland](/wiki/Iceland
"Iceland"), but that [Adam of Bremen](/wiki/Adam\_of\_Bremen "Adam of Bremen")
describes a [huge tree standing next to the Temple at
Uppsala](/wiki/Sacred\_tree\_at\_Uppsala "Sacred tree at Uppsala") in
[Sweden](/wiki/Sweden "Sweden"), which remained green throughout summer and
winter, and that no one knew what type it was. Davidson comments that while it
is uncertain if Adam's informant actually witnessed the tree, the existence of
sacred trees in pre-Christian Germanic Europe is further evidenced by records
of their destruction by early Christian missionaries, such as [Thor's
Oak](/wiki/Thor%27s\_Oak "Thor's Oak") by [Saint Boniface](/wiki/Saint\_Boniface
"Saint Boniface").[27]

[Ken Dowden](/wiki/Ken\_Dowden "Ken Dowden") comments that behind Irminsul,
Thor's Oak in Geismar, and the sacred tree at [Uppsala](/wiki/Uppsala
"Uppsala") "looms a mythic prototype, an Yggdrasil, the world-ash of the
[Norsemen](/wiki/Norsemen "Norsemen")".[28]
