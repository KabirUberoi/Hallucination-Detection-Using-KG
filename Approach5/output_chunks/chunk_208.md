Arab world")

Conspiracy theories are a prevalent feature of [Arab](/wiki/Arab "Arab")
culture and politics.[161] Variants include conspiracies involving
colonialism, [Zionism](/wiki/Zionism "Zionism"), superpowers, oil, and the
[war on terrorism](/wiki/War\_on\_terrorism "War on terrorism"), which is often
referred to in Arab media as a "[war against Islam](/wiki/War\_against\_Islam
"War against Islam")".[161] For example, \_[The Protocols of the Elders of
Zion](/wiki/The\_Protocols\_of\_the\_Elders\_of\_Zion "The Protocols of the Elders
of Zion")\_ , an infamous [hoax](/wiki/Hoax "Hoax") document purporting to be a
Jewish plan for world domination, is commonly read and promoted in the Muslim
world.[162][163][164] [Roger Cohen](/wiki/Roger\_Cohen "Roger Cohen") has
suggested that the popularity of conspiracy theories in the Arab world is "the
ultimate refuge of the powerless".[129] Al-Mumin Said has noted the danger of
such theories, for they "keep us not only from the truth but also from
confronting our faults and problems".[165]

[Osama bin Laden](/wiki/Osama\_bin\_Laden "Osama bin Laden") and [Ayman al-
Zawahiri](/wiki/Ayman\_al-Zawahiri "Ayman al-Zawahiri") used conspiracy
theories about the [United States](/wiki/United\_States "United States") to
gain support for [al-Qaeda](/wiki/Al-Qaeda "Al-Qaeda") in the Arab world, and
as rhetoric to distinguish themselves from similar groups, although they may
not have believed the conspiratorial claims themselves.[166]
