(1791–1867)

In 1800, [Alessandro Volta](/wiki/Alessandro\_Volta "Alessandro Volta")
invented the electric battery (known as the [voltaic pile](/wiki/Voltaic\_pile
"Voltaic pile")) and thus improved the way electric currents could also be
studied. A year later, [Thomas Young](/wiki/Thomas\_Young\_\(scientist\) "Thomas
Young \(scientist\)") demonstrated the wave nature of light—which received
strong experimental support from the work of [Augustin-Jean
Fresnel](/wiki/Augustin-Jean\_Fresnel "Augustin-Jean Fresnel")—and the
principle of interference. In 1820, [Hans Christian
Ørsted](/wiki/Hans\_Christian\_%C3%98rsted "Hans Christian Ørsted") found that a
current-carrying conductor gives rise to a magnetic force surrounding it, and
within a week after Ørsted's discovery reached France, [André-Marie
Ampère](/wiki/Andr%C3%A9-Marie\_Amp%C3%A8re "André-Marie Ampère") discovered
that two parallel electric currents will exert forces on each other. In 1821,
[Michael Faraday](/wiki/Michael\_Faraday "Michael Faraday") built an
electricity-powered motor, while [Georg Ohm](/wiki/Georg\_Ohm "Georg Ohm")
stated his law of electrical resistance in 1826, expressing the relationship
between voltage, current, and resistance in an electric circuit.

In 1831, Faraday (and independently [Joseph Henry](/wiki/Joseph\_Henry "Joseph
Henry")) discovered the reverse effect, the production of an electric
potential or current through magnetism – known as [electromagnetic
induction](/wiki/Faraday%27s\_law\_of\_induction "Faraday's law of induction");
these two discoveries are the basis of the electric motor and the electric
generator, respectively.
