(1895) by [Lorenz Frølich](/wiki/Lorenz\_Fr%C3%B8lich "Lorenz Frølich")

The generally accepted meaning of Old Norse \_\_Yggdrasill\_\_ is "Odin's horse",
meaning "[gallows](/wiki/Gallows "Gallows")". This interpretation comes about
because \_\_drasill\_\_ means "horse" and \_\_Ygg(r)\_\_ is one of [Odin's many
names](/wiki/List\_of\_names\_of\_Odin#Yggr "List of names of Odin"). The \_Poetic
Edda\_ poem \_\_[Hávamál](/wiki/H%C3%A1vam%C3%A1l "Hávamál")\_\_ describes how Odin
sacrificed himself by hanging from a tree, making this tree Odin's gallows.
This tree may have been Yggdrasil. "The horse of the hanged" is a
[kenning](/wiki/Kenning "Kenning") for gallows and therefore Odin's gallows
may have developed into the expression "Odin's horse", which then became the
name of the tree.[1]

Nevertheless, scholarly opinions regarding the precise meaning of the name
\_\_Yggdrasill\_\_ vary, particularly on the issue of whether \_\_Yggdrasill\_\_ is
the name of the tree itself or if only the full term \_\_askr Yggdrasil\_\_ (where
Old Norse \_\_askr\_\_ means "ash tree") refers specifically to the tree.
According to this interpretation, \_\_askr Yggdrasils\_\_ would mean the [world
tree](/wiki/World\_tree "World tree") upon which "the horse [Odin's horse] of
the highest god [Odin] is bound". Both of these etymologies rely on a presumed
but unattested \_\*Yggsdrasill\_.[1]

A third interpretation, presented by F. Detter, is that the name
\_\_Yggdrasill\_\_ refers to the word \_\_yggr\_\_ ("terror"), yet not in reference to
the Odinic name, and so \_\_Yggdrasill\_\_ would then mean "tree of terror,
gallows". F. R. Schröder has proposed a fourth etymology according to which
\_\_yggdrasill\_\_ means "yew pillar", deriving \_\_yggia\_\_ from \_\*igwja\_ (meaning
"[yew-tree](/wiki/Taxus\_baccata "Taxus baccata")"), and \_\_drasill\_\_ from
\_\*dher-\_ (meaning "support").[1]
