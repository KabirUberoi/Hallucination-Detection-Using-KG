### Use of game theory in defence science and
technology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Game\_theory&action=edit&section=33 "Edit
section: Use of game theory in defence science and technology")]

Game theory has been used extensively to model decision-making scenarios
relevant to defence applications.[121] Most studies that has applied game
theory in defence settings are concerned with Command and Control Warfare, and
can be further classified into studies dealing with (i) Resource Allocation
Warfare (ii) Information Warfare (iii) Weapons Control Warfare, and (iv)
Adversary Monitoring Warfare.[121] Many of the problems studied are concerned
with sensing and tracking, for example a surface ship trying to track a
hostile submarine and the submarine trying to evade being tracked, and the
interdependent decision making that takes place with regards to bearing,
speed, and the sensor technology activated by both vessels. Ho et al [121]
provides a concise summary of the state-of-the-art with regards to the use of
game theory in defence applications and highlights the benefits and
limitations of game theory in the considered scenarios.
