A conspiracy theory can be local or international, focused on single events or
covering multiple incidents and entire countries, regions and periods of
history.[10] According to [Russell Muirhead](/wiki/Russell\_Muirhead "Russell
Muirhead") and [Nancy Rosenblum](/wiki/Nancy\_Rosenblum "Nancy Rosenblum"),
historically, traditional conspiracism has entailed a "theory", but over time,
"conspiracy" and "theory" have become decoupled, as modern conspiracism is
often without any kind of theory behind it.[74][75]
