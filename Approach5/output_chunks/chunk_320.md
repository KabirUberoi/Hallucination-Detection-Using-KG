## Abuse of
women[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Virginity\_test&action=edit&section=5 "Edit
section: Abuse of women")]

[Egypt](/wiki/Egypt "Egypt")'s military forces performed virginity tests on
women detained during the [2011 Egyptian
revolution](/wiki/2011\_Egyptian\_revolution "2011 Egyptian revolution"). After
[Amnesty International](/wiki/Amnesty\_International "Amnesty International")
protested to the [Egyptian government](/wiki/Egyptian\_government "Egyptian
government") in March 2011,[24] the government claimed the tests were carried
out in order to refute claims that the women had been raped while in
detention. Amnesty International described the virginity tests as "nothing
less than torture".[25] Virginity tests done by the military on detainees were
banned in Egypt on 27 December 2011,[26] but in March 2012, the physician who
carried out the tests was acquitted of all charges.[27] Samira Ibrahim, the
Egyptian woman who filed the lawsuit against the government that initiated
public discussion of their use of virginity testing, said in response to the
physician's acquittal: "A woman's body should not be used as a tool for
intimidation, and nobody should have their dignity violated."[28]

Prior to the 1980s, virginity testing was also used on women entering the
[United Kingdom](/wiki/United\_Kingdom "United Kingdom") on what was popularly
called a fiancée visa, when they said they were
[immigrating](/wiki/Immigrating "Immigrating") to [marry](/wiki/Marry "Marry")
their fiancées who were already living in the country.[29] The British
government argued that if the women were virgins, they were more likely to be
telling the truth about their reason for immigrating to the country.[29] In
January 1979, a woman was required by British immigration officers to undergo
a virginity test when she arrived in London claiming that she was there to
marry. Such a visit did not require a visa, but as proof of her \_[bona
fides](/wiki/Bona\_fides "Bona fides")\_ , she was required to submit to the
test.[30] This practice was exposed by \_[The Guardian](/wiki/The\_Guardian "The
Guardian")\_ in 1979[31] and the policy was quickly changed.[29][32][30]

[Virginity testing in Indonesia](/wiki/Virginity\_testing\_in\_Indonesia
"Virginity testing in Indonesia") for female applicants to the military and
police has been practiced since 1965 and is carried out during medical
examinations. An announcement was made in August 2013 in
[Prabumulih](/wiki/Prabumulih "Prabumulih") district, [South
Sumatra](/wiki/South\_Sumatra "South Sumatra"), [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia
"Indonesia"), by local education chief Muhammad Rasyid, that teenage girls
attending high school there would be given mandatory annual virginity tests,
beginning in 2014.[33] The stated intent was to reduce
[promiscuity](/wiki/Promiscuity "Promiscuity") in the district.[34] In 2014
the [Human Rights Watch](/wiki/Human\_Rights\_Watch "Human Rights Watch")
reported that a physical virginity test is routinely performed on female
candidates to the [Indonesian National
Police](/wiki/Indonesian\_National\_Police "Indonesian National Police") as part
of the job application process.[35] 
In August 2021, the [Indonesian Army](/wiki/Indonesian\_Army "Indonesian Army")
Chief of Staff [General Andika Perkasa](/wiki/Andika\_Perkasa "Andika Perkasa")
officially announced that the army will no longer conduct virginity testing
for female recruits. The navy and air force had already stopped conducting
virginity tests.[36][37][38]

In [Iran](/wiki/Iran "Iran"), [Atena Farghadani](/wiki/Atena\_Farghadani "Atena
Farghadani") was charged with "illicit sexual relations falling short of
adultery" for shaking hands with her lawyer in June 2015. She complained that
Iranian prison officials and guards have made lewd gestures, sexual slurs and
other insults to her, and went on a three-day "dry" hunger strike in September
2015 in protest of this ill-treatment. However, the harassment continued. In a
note written by Farghadani leaked from prison, which has been seen by Amnesty
International, Farghadani says the judicial authorities took her to a medical
center outside the prison on 12 August 2015 and forced her to submit to a
virginity test, purportedly for the purpose of investigating the charge
against her.[39]

In India's Kanjarbhat community, after a marriage ceremony takes place, a
virginity test is carried out on the newly-married wife using a white bed
sheet. If the woman bleeds following intercourse with her new husband, it is
declared that 'Maal khara hai' (the goods are pure) and if she does not bleed,
the council will declare that 'Maal khota hai' (the goods are
spoiled).[40][41] In 2019, the [Maharashtra](/wiki/Maharashtra "Maharashtra")
state government announced that it intended to make virginity tests for brides
a punishable offence, describing the practice as form of sexual assault.[42]

Virginity tests are common in [Afghanistan](/wiki/Afghanistan "Afghanistan").
Some women undergo multiple tests. The tests are often done without the
woman's consent. They have drawn widespread condemnation, with critics saying
they are inhumane and hurt the dignity of women.[43]
