"Edit section: Apartment building elevator")]

In the apartment building where Sheldon, Leonard, and Penny (and later Amy)
live, the elevator has been out of order throughout most of the series,
forcing characters to have to use the stairs. Stairway conversations between
characters occur in almost every episode, often serving as a transition
between longer scenes. The Season 3 episode, "The Staircase Implementation"
reveals that the elevator was broken when Leonard was experimenting with
rocket fuel.[93] In the penultimate episode of the series, the elevator is
returned to an operational state, causing Sheldon some angst, until he
realizes that the fixed elevator reverted things to the "status quo".
