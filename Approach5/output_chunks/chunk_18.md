### Regarding the term
"theoretical"[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Theory&action=edit&section=11 "Edit
section: Regarding the term "theoretical"")]

Certain tests may be infeasible or technically difficult. As a result,
theories may make predictions that have not been confirmed or proven
incorrect. These predictions may be described informally as "theoretical".
They can be tested later, and if they are incorrect, this may lead to
revision, invalidation, or rejection of the theory. [20]
