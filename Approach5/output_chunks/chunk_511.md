of Galileo by [Pio Fedi](/wiki/Pio\_Fedi "Pio Fedi") (1815–1892) inside the
Lanyon Building of the [Queen's University of
Belfast](/wiki/Queen%27s\_University\_of\_Belfast "Queen's University of
Belfast"). Sir [William Whitla](/wiki/William\_Whitla "William Whitla")
(Professor of [Materia Medica](/wiki/Materia\_Medica "Materia Medica")
1890–1919) brought the statue back from Italy and donated it to the
university.

Galileo's early works describing scientific instruments include the 1586 tract
entitled \_The Little Balance\_ (\_La Billancetta\_) describing an accurate
balance to weigh objects in air or water[243] and the 1606 printed manual \_Le
Operazioni del Compasso Geometrico et Militare\_ on the operation of a
geometrical and military compass.[244]

His early works on dynamics, the science of motion and mechanics were his
\_circa\_ 1590 Pisan \_[De Motu](/wiki/De\_Motu\_Antiquiora "De Motu Antiquiora")\_
(On Motion) and his \_circa\_ 1600 Paduan \_Le Meccaniche\_ (Mechanics). The
former was based on Aristotelian–Archimedean fluid dynamics and held that the
speed of gravitational fall in a fluid medium was proportional to the excess
of a body's specific weight over that of the medium, whereby in a vacuum,
bodies would fall with speeds in proportion to their specific weights. It also
subscribed to the Philoponan [impetus dynamics](/wiki/Impetus\_dynamics
"Impetus dynamics") in which impetus is self-dissipating and free-fall in a
vacuum would have an essential terminal speed according to specific weight
after an initial period of acceleration.[\_[citation

Galileo's 1610 \_[The Starry Messenger](/wiki/Sidereus\_Nuncius "Sidereus
Nuncius")\_ (\_Sidereus Nuncius\_) was the first scientific treatise to be
published based on observations made through a telescope. It reported his
discoveries of:

 \* the [Galilean moons](/wiki/Galilean\_moons "Galilean moons")
 \* the roughness of the Moon's surface
 \* the existence of a large number of stars invisible to the naked eye, particularly those responsible for the appearance of the [Milky Way](/wiki/Milky\_Way "Milky Way")
 \* differences between the appearances of the planets and those of the fixed stars—the former appearing as small discs, while the latter appeared as unmagnified points of light

Galileo published a description of sunspots in 1613 entitled \_[Letters on
Sunspots](/wiki/Letters\_on\_Sunspots "Letters on Sunspots")\_ suggesting the Sun
and heavens are corruptible.[245] The \_Letters on Sunspots\_ also reported his
1610 telescopic observations of the full set of phases of Venus, and his
discovery of the puzzling "appendages" of Saturn and their even more puzzling
subsequent disappearance. In 1615, Galileo prepared a manuscript known as the
"[Letter to the Grand Duchess
Christina](/wiki/Letter\_to\_the\_Grand\_Duchess\_Christina "Letter to the Grand
Duchess Christina")" which was not published in printed form until 1636. This
letter was a revised version of the \_Letter to Castelli\_ , which was denounced
by the Inquisition as an incursion upon theology by advocating Copernicanism
both as physically true and as consistent with Scripture.[246] In 1616, after
the order by the Inquisition for Galileo not to hold or defend the Copernican
position, Galileo wrote the "[Discourse on the
Tides](/wiki/Discourse\_on\_the\_Tides "Discourse on the Tides")" (\_Discorso sul
flusso e il reflusso del mare\_) based on the Copernican earth, in the form of
a private letter to [Cardinal Orsini](/wiki/Alessandro\_Orsini\_\(cardinal\)
"Alessandro Orsini \(cardinal\)").[247] In 1619, Mario Guiducci, a pupil of
Galileo's, published a lecture written largely by Galileo under the title
\_Discourse on the Comets\_ (\_Discorso Delle Comete\_), arguing against the
Jesuit interpretation of comets.[248]

In 1623, Galileo published \_[The Assayer](/wiki/The\_Assayer "The Assayer")—Il
Saggiatore\_, which attacked theories based on Aristotle's authority and
promoted experimentation and the mathematical formulation of scientific ideas.
The book was highly successful and even found support among the higher
echelons of the Christian church.[249] Following the success of \_The Assayer\_
, Galileo published the \_Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems\_
(\_Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo\_) in 1632. Despite taking care
to adhere to the Inquisition's 1616 instructions, the claims in the book
favouring Copernican theory and a non-geocentric model of the solar system led
to Galileo being tried and banned from publication. Despite the publication
ban, Galileo published his \_[Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations
Relating to Two New Sciences](/wiki/Two\_New\_Sciences "Two New Sciences")\_
(\_Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche, intorno a due nuove scienze\_) in 1638
in [Holland](/wiki/House\_of\_Elzevir "House of Elzevir"), outside the
jurisdiction of the Inquisition.[\_[citation
