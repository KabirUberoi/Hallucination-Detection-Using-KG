Arabic numeral system. The inscriptions on the [edicts of
Ashoka](/wiki/Edicts\_of\_Ashoka "Edicts of Ashoka") (3rd century BCE) display
this number system being used by the Imperial [Mauryas](/wiki/Maurya\_Empire
"Maurya Empire").

Important physical and mathematical traditions also existed in [ancient
Chinese](/wiki/History\_of\_science\_and\_technology\_in\_China "History of science
and technology in China") and [Indian
sciences](/wiki/History\_of\_Indian\_science\_and\_technology "History of Indian
science and technology").

maps](/wiki/Star\_map "Star map") by the 11th-century Chinese
[polymath](/wiki/Polymath "Polymath") [Su Song](/wiki/Su\_Song "Su Song") are
the oldest known [woodblock-printed](/wiki/Woodblock\_printing "Woodblock
printing") star maps to have survived to the present day. This example, dated
1092,[note 1] employs the cylindrical [equirectangular
projection](/wiki/Equirectangular\_projection "Equirectangular projection").[2]

In [Indian philosophy](/wiki/Indian\_philosophy "Indian philosophy"), Maharishi
[Kanada](/wiki/Kanada\_\(philosopher\) "Kanada \(philosopher\)") was the first
to systematically develop a theory of atomism around 200 BCE[3] though some
authors have allotted him an earlier era in the 6th century BCE.[4][5] It was
further elaborated by the [Buddhist atomists](/wiki/Buddhist\_atomism "Buddhist
atomism") [Dharmakirti](/wiki/Dharmakirti "Dharmakirti") and
[Dignāga](/wiki/Dign%C4%81ga "Dignāga") during the 1st millennium CE.[6]
[Pakudha Kaccayana](/wiki/Pakudha\_Kaccayana "Pakudha Kaccayana"), a 6th-
century BCE Indian philosopher and contemporary of [Gautama
Buddha](/wiki/Gautama\_Buddha "Gautama Buddha"), had also propounded ideas
about the atomic constitution of the material world. These philosophers
believed that other elements (except ether) were physically palpable and hence
comprised minuscule particles of matter. The last minuscule particle of matter
that could not be subdivided further was termed [Parmanu](/wiki/Atom "Atom").
These philosophers considered the atom to be indestructible and hence eternal.
The Buddhists thought atoms to be minute objects unable to be seen to the
naked eye that come into being and vanish in an instant. The
[Vaisheshika](/wiki/Vaisheshika "Vaisheshika") school of philosophers believed
that an atom was a mere point in [space](/wiki/Space "Space"). It was also
first to depict relations between motion and force applied. Indian theories
about the atom are greatly abstract and enmeshed in philosophy as they were
based on logic and not on personal experience or experimentation. In [Indian
astronomy](/wiki/Indian\_astronomy "Indian astronomy"),
[Aryabhata](/wiki/Aryabhata "Aryabhata")'s \_[Aryabhatiya](/wiki/Aryabhatiya
"Aryabhatiya")\_ (499 CE) proposed the [Earth's
rotation](/wiki/Earth%27s\_rotation "Earth's rotation"), while [Nilakantha
Somayaji](/wiki/Nilakantha\_Somayaji "Nilakantha Somayaji") (1444–1544) of the
[Kerala school of astronomy and
mathematics](/wiki/Kerala\_school\_of\_astronomy\_and\_mathematics "Kerala school
of astronomy and mathematics") proposed a semi-heliocentric model resembling
the [Tychonic system](/wiki/Tychonic\_system "Tychonic system").

The study of [magnetism](/wiki/Magnetism "Magnetism") in [Ancient
China](/wiki/History\_of\_China#Ancient\_China "History of China") dates back to
the 4th century BCE. (in the \_Book of the Devil Valley Master\_),[7] A main
contributor to this field was [Shen Kuo](/wiki/Shen\_Kuo "Shen Kuo")
(1031–1095), a [polymath](/wiki/Polymath "Polymath") and statesman who was the
first to describe the [magnetic-needle compass](/wiki/Compass "Compass") used
for navigation, as well as establishing the concept of [true
north](/wiki/True\_north "True north"). In optics, Shen Kuo independently
developed a [camera obscura](/wiki/Camera\_obscura "Camera obscura").[8]
