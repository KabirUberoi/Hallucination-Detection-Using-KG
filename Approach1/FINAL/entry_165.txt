Ground Truth : 
carlos arniches 11 october 1866 16 april 1943 was a spanish playwright born in alicante. his prolific work drawing on the traditions of the género chico the zarzuela and the grotesque came to dominate spanish comic theatre in the early twentieth century. after starting his career as a novelist and journalist arniches turned to theatre in 1888 with the publication of his first play casa editorial. much of his work is set in lowerclass madrid and uses colloquial language song dance and music. arniches was complimented in a 1935 interview by federico garcía lorca often a scathing critic of spanish theatre in the 1920s and 1930s as more of a poet than almost any of those who are writing theatre in verse at the moment. following the consolidation of the franco regime after the spanish civil war the social dramas of carlos arniches were among the relatively noncontroversial plays allowed by the new government.
