Psychological motives for believing in conspiracy theories can be categorized
as epistemic, existential, or social. These motives are particularly acute in
vulnerable and disadvantaged populations. However, it does not appear that the
beliefs help to address these motives; in fact, they may be self-defeating,
acting to make the situation worse instead.[41][103] For example, while
conspiratorial beliefs can result from a perceived sense of
[powerlessness](/wiki/Empowerment "Empowerment"), exposure to conspiracy
theories immediately suppresses personal feelings of autonomy and control.
Furthermore, they also make people less likely to take actions that could
improve their circumstances.[41][103]

This is additionally supported by the fact that conspiracy theories have a
number of disadvantageous attributes.[41] For example, they promote a negative
and distrustful view of other people and groups, who are allegedly acting
based on antisocial and cynical motivations. This is expected to lead to
increased [alienation](/wiki/Social\_alienation "Social alienation") and
[anomie](/wiki/Anomie "Anomie"), and reduced [social
capital](/wiki/Social\_capital "Social capital"). Similarly, they depict the
public as ignorant and powerless against the alleged conspirators, with
important aspects of society determined by malevolent forces, a viewpoint
which is likely to be disempowering.[41]

Each person may endorse conspiracy theories for one of many different
reasons.[119] The most consistently demonstrated characteristics of people who
find conspiracy theories appealing are a feeling of
[alienation](/wiki/Social\_alienation "Social alienation"), unhappiness or
dissatisfaction with their situation, an unconventional worldview, and a
feeling of [disempowerment](/wiki/Disempowerment "Disempowerment").[119] While
various aspects of personality affect susceptibility to conspiracy theories,
none of the [Big Five personality traits](/wiki/Big\_Five\_personality\_traits
"Big Five personality traits") are associated with conspiracy beliefs.[119]

The political scientist [Michael Barkun](/wiki/Michael\_Barkun "Michael
Barkun"), discussing the usage of "conspiracy theory" in contemporary American
culture, holds that this term is used for a belief that explains an event as
the result of a secret plot by exceptionally powerful and cunning conspirators
to achieve a malevolent end.[120][121] According to Barkun, the appeal of
conspiracism is threefold:

> \* First, conspiracy theories claim to explain what [institutional
> analysis](/wiki/Institutional\_analysis "Institutional analysis") cannot.
> They appear to make sense out of a world that is otherwise confusing.
> \* Second, they do so in an appealingly simple way, by dividing the world
> sharply between [the forces of light, and the forces of
> darkness](/wiki/Manichaeism "Manichaeism"). They trace all evil back to a
> single source, the conspirators and their agents.
> \* Third, conspiracy theories are often presented as special, [secret
> knowledge](/wiki/Esotericism "Esotericism") unknown or unappreciated by
> others. For conspiracy theorists, the masses are a [brainwashed
> herd](/wiki/Sheeple "Sheeple"), while the conspiracy theorists in the know
> can congratulate themselves on penetrating the plotters' deceptions.[121]

This third point is supported by research of Roland Imhoff, professor of
[social psychology](/wiki/Social\_psychology "Social psychology") at the
[Johannes Gutenberg University
Mainz](/wiki/Johannes\_Gutenberg\_University\_Mainz "Johannes Gutenberg
University Mainz"). The research suggests that the smaller the minority
believing in a specific theory, the more attractive it is to conspiracy
theorists.[122]

[Humanistic psychologists](/wiki/Humanistic\_psychology "Humanistic
psychology") argue that even if a posited cabal behind an alleged conspiracy
is almost always perceived as hostile, there often remains an element of
reassurance for theorists. This is because it is a consolation to imagine that
difficulties in human affairs are created by humans, and remain within human
control. If a cabal can be implicated, there may be a hope of breaking its
power or of joining it. Belief in the power of a cabal is an implicit
assertion of human dignityâ€”an unconscious affirmation that man is responsible
for his own destiny.[123]

People formulate conspiracy theories to explain, for example, power relations
in social groups and the perceived existence of evil forces.[c][121][106][107]
Proposed psychological origins of conspiracy theorising include projection;
the personal need to explain "a significant event [with] a significant cause;"
and the product of various kinds and stages of thought disorder, such as
paranoid disposition, ranging in severity to diagnosable mental illnesses.
Some people prefer socio-political explanations over the insecurity of
encountering [random](/wiki/Randomness "Randomness"), unpredictable, or
otherwise inexplicable events.[124][125][126][127][128][129]

According to Berlet and Lyons, "Conspiracism is a particular narrative form of
scapegoating that frames demonized enemies as part of a vast insidious plot
against the common good, while it valorizes the scapegoater as a hero for
sounding the alarm".[130]
