[William Poundstone](/wiki/William\_Poundstone "William Poundstone") described
the game in his 1993 book Prisoner's Dilemma:[147]

Two members of a criminal gang, A and B, are arrested and imprisoned. Each
prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communication with their
partner. The principal charge would lead to a sentence of ten years in prison;
however, the police do not have the evidence for a conviction. They plan to
sentence both to two years in prison on a lesser charge but offer each
prisoner a Faustian bargain: If one of them confesses to the crime of the
principal charge, betraying the other, they will be pardoned and free to leave
while the other must serve the entirety of the sentence instead of just two
years for the lesser charge.

The [dominant strategy](/wiki/Dominant\_strategy "Dominant strategy") (and
therefore the best response to any possible opponent strategy), is to betray
the other, which aligns with the [sure-thing principle](/wiki/Sure-
thing\_principle "Sure-thing principle").[148] However, both prisoners staying
silent would yield a greater reward for both of them than mutual betrayal.
