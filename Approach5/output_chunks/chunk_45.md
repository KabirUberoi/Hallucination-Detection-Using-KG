### Howard's
mother[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The\_Big\_Bang\_Theory&action=edit&section=13
"Edit section: Howard's mother")]

In scenes set at Howard's home, he interacts with his rarely seen mother
(voiced by [Carol Ann Susi](/wiki/Carol\_Ann\_Susi "Carol Ann Susi") until her
death) by shouting from room to room in the house. She similarly interacts
with other characters in this manner.[89] She reflects the [Jewish mother
stereotype](/wiki/Jewish\_mother\_stereotype "Jewish mother stereotype") in some
ways, such as being overly controlling of Howard's adult life and sometimes
trying to make him feel guilty about causing her trouble. She is dependent on
Howard, as she requires him to help her with her wig and makeup in the
morning. Howard, in turn, is attached to his mother to the point where she
still cuts his meat for him, takes him to the dentist, does his laundry and
"grounds" him when he returns home after briefly moving out.[90] Until
Howard's marriage to Bernadette in the fifth-season finale, Howard's former
living situation led Leonard's psychiatrist mother to speculate that he may
suffer from some type of pathology[91] and Sheldon to refer to their
relationship as [Oedipal](/wiki/Oedipus\_complex "Oedipus complex").[92] In
season 8, Howard's mother dies in her sleep while in Florida, which devastates
Howard and Stuart, who briefly lived with Mrs. Wolowitz.
