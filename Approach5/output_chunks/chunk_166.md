Special relativity is a theory of the structure of [spacetime](/wiki/Spacetime
"Spacetime"). It was introduced in Einstein's 1905 paper "[On the
Electrodynamics of Moving
Bodies](/wiki/On\_the\_Electrodynamics\_of\_Moving\_Bodies "On the Electrodynamics
of Moving Bodies")" (for the contributions of many other physicists and
mathematicians, see [History of special
relativity](/wiki/History\_of\_special\_relativity "History of special
relativity")). Special relativity is based on two postulates which are
contradictory in [classical mechanics](/wiki/Classical\_mechanics "Classical
mechanics"):

 1. The [laws of physics](/wiki/Laws\_of\_physics "Laws of physics") are the same for all observers in any [inertial frame of reference](/wiki/Inertial\_frame\_of\_reference "Inertial frame of reference") relative to one another ([principle of relativity](/wiki/Principle\_of\_relativity "Principle of relativity")).
 2. The [speed of light](/wiki/Speed\_of\_light "Speed of light") in [vacuum](/wiki/Vacuum "Vacuum") is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion or of the motion of the [light](/wiki/Light "Light") source.

The resultant theory copes with experiment better than classical mechanics.
For instance, postulate 2 explains the results of the [Michelson–Morley
experiment](/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley\_experiment "Michelson–Morley
experiment"). Moreover, the theory has many surprising and counterintuitive
consequences. Some of these are:

 \* [Relativity of simultaneity](/wiki/Relativity\_of\_simultaneity "Relativity of simultaneity"): Two events, simultaneous for one observer, may not be simultaneous for another observer if the observers are in relative motion.
 \* [Time dilation](/wiki/Time\_dilation "Time dilation"): Moving [clocks](/wiki/Clock "Clock") are measured to tick more slowly than an observer's "stationary" clock.
 \* [Length contraction](/wiki/Length\_contraction "Length contraction"): Objects are measured to be shortened in the direction that they are moving with respect to the observer.
 \* [Maximum speed is finite](/wiki/Speed\_of\_light#Upper\_limit\_on\_speeds "Speed of light"): No physical object, message or field line can travel faster than the speed of light in vacuum. 
 \* The effect of gravity can only travel through space at the speed of light, not faster or instantaneously.
 \* [Mass–energy equivalence](/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy\_equivalence "Mass–energy equivalence"): \_E\_ = \_mc\_ 2, energy and mass are equivalent and transmutable.
 \* [Relativistic mass](/wiki/Mass\_in\_special\_relativity "Mass in special relativity"), idea used by some researchers.[9]

The defining feature of special relativity is the replacement of the [Galilean
transformations](/wiki/Galilean\_transformation "Galilean transformation") of
classical mechanics by the [Lorentz
transformations](/wiki/Lorentz\_transformation "Lorentz transformation"). (See
[Maxwell's equations](/wiki/Maxwell%27s\_equations "Maxwell's equations") of
[electromagnetism](/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism").)
