In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the [speed of
light](/wiki/Speed\_of\_light#Measurement "Speed of light") by arranging that
two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each
other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his
lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of
his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and
seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes
light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported
that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to
determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously.[198] Sometime
between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine \_[Accademia
del Cimento](/wiki/Accademia\_del\_Cimento "Accademia del Cimento")\_ repeated
the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly
inconclusive result.[199] The speed of light has since been determined to be
far too fast to be measured by such methods.
