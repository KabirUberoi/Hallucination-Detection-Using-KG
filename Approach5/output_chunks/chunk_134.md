As a method of [applied mathematics](/wiki/Applied\_mathematics "Applied
mathematics"), game theory has been used to study a wide variety of human and
animal behaviors. It was initially developed in [economics](/wiki/Economics
"Economics") to understand a large collection of economic behaviors, including
behaviors of firms, markets, and consumers. The first use of game-theoretic
analysis was by [Antoine Augustin Cournot](/wiki/Antoine\_Augustin\_Cournot
"Antoine Augustin Cournot") in 1838 with his solution of the [Cournot
duopoly](/wiki/Cournot\_competition "Cournot competition"). The use of game
theory in the social sciences has expanded, and game theory has been applied
to political, sociological, and psychological behaviors as well.[68]

Although pre-twentieth-century [naturalists](/wiki/Natural\_history "Natural
history") such as [Charles Darwin](/wiki/Charles\_Darwin "Charles Darwin") made
game-theoretic kinds of statements, the use of game-theoretic analysis in
biology began with [Ronald Fisher](/wiki/Ronald\_Fisher "Ronald Fisher")'s
studies of animal behavior during the 1930s. This work predates the name "game
theory", but it shares many important features with this field. The
developments in economics were later applied to biology largely by John
Maynard Smith in his 1982 book \_[Evolution and the Theory of
Games](/wiki/Evolution\_and\_the\_Theory\_of\_Games "Evolution and the Theory of
Games")\_.[69]

In addition to being used to describe, predict, and explain behavior, game
theory has also been used to develop theories of ethical or normative behavior
and to
[prescribe](/wiki/Decision\_theory#Normative\_and\_descriptive\_decision\_theory
"Decision theory") such behavior.[70] In [economics and
philosophy](/wiki/Economics\_and\_philosophy "Economics and philosophy"),
scholars have applied game theory to help in the understanding of good or
proper behavior. Game-theoretic approaches have also been suggested in the
[philosophy of language](/wiki/Philosophy\_of\_language "Philosophy of
language") and [philosophy of science](/wiki/Philosophy\_of\_science "Philosophy
of science").[71] Game-theoretic arguments of this type can be found as far
back as [Plato](/wiki/Plato "Plato").[72] An alternative version of game
theory, called [chemical game theory](/wiki/Chemical\_game\_theory "Chemical
game theory"), represents the player's choices as metaphorical chemical
reactant molecules called "knowlecules".[73] Chemical game theory then
calculates the outcomes as equilibrium solutions to a system of chemical
reactions.
