In the AdS/CFT correspondence, the geometry of spacetime is described in terms
of a certain [vacuum solution](/wiki/Vacuum\_solution "Vacuum solution") of
[Einstein's equation](/wiki/Einstein%27s\_equation "Einstein's equation")
called [anti-de Sitter space](/wiki/Anti-de\_Sitter\_space "Anti-de Sitter
space").[6] In very elementary terms, anti-de Sitter space is a mathematical
model of spacetime in which the notion of distance between points (the
[metric](/wiki/Metric\_tensor "Metric tensor")) is different from the notion of
distance in ordinary [Euclidean geometry](/wiki/Euclidean\_geometry "Euclidean
geometry"). It is closely related to [hyperbolic space](/wiki/Hyperbolic\_space
"Hyperbolic space"), which can be viewed as a
[disk](/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9\_disk\_model "Poincaré disk model") as illustrated on
the left.[71] This image shows a [tessellation](/wiki/Tessellation
"Tessellation") of a disk by triangles and squares. One can define the
distance between points of this disk in such a way that all the triangles and
squares are the same size and the circular outer boundary is infinitely far
from any point in the interior.[72]

One can imagine a stack of hyperbolic disks where each disk represents the
state of the universe at a given time. The resulting geometric object is
three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space.[71] It looks like a solid
[cylinder](/wiki/Cylinder\_\(geometry\) "Cylinder \(geometry\)") in which any
[cross section](/wiki/Cross\_section\_\(geometry\) "Cross section \(geometry\)")
is a copy of the hyperbolic disk. Time runs along the vertical direction in
this picture. The surface of this cylinder plays an important role in the
AdS/CFT correspondence. As with the hyperbolic plane, anti-de Sitter space is
[curved](/wiki/Curvature "Curvature") in such a way that any point in the
interior is actually infinitely far from this boundary surface.[72]

[![A cylinder formed by stacking copies of the disk illustrated in the

AdS3.svg.png)](/wiki/File:AdS3.svg)Three-dimensional [anti-de Sitter
space](/wiki/Anti-de\_Sitter\_space "Anti-de Sitter space") is like a stack of
[hyperbolic disks](/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9\_disk\_model "Poincaré disk model"), each
one representing the state of the universe at a given time. The resulting
[spacetime](/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") looks like a solid
[cylinder](/wiki/Cylinder\_\(geometry\) "Cylinder \(geometry\)").

This construction describes a hypothetical universe with only two space
dimensions and one time dimension, but it can be generalized to any number of
dimensions. Indeed, hyperbolic space can have more than two dimensions and one
can "stack up" copies of hyperbolic space to get higher-dimensional models of
anti-de Sitter space.[71]

An important feature of anti-de Sitter space is its boundary (which looks like
a cylinder in the case of three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space). One
property of this boundary is that, within a small region on the surface around
any given point, it looks just like [Minkowski space](/wiki/Minkowski\_space
"Minkowski space"), the model of spacetime used in nongravitational
physics.[73] One can therefore consider an auxiliary theory in which
"spacetime" is given by the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. This observation
is the starting point for AdS/CFT correspondence, which states that the
boundary of anti-de Sitter space can be regarded as the "spacetime" for a
quantum field theory. The claim is that this quantum field theory is
equivalent to a gravitational theory, such as string theory, in the bulk anti-
de Sitter space in the sense that there is a "dictionary" for translating
entities and calculations in one theory into their counterparts in the other
theory. For example, a single particle in the gravitational theory might
correspond to some collection of particles in the boundary theory. In
addition, the predictions in the two theories are quantitatively identical so
that if two particles have a 40 percent chance of colliding in the
gravitational theory, then the corresponding collections in the boundary
theory would also have a 40 percent chance of colliding.[74]
