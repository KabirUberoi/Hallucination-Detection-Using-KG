### Philosophical views[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Theory&action=edit&section=9
"Edit section: Philosophical views")]

The [logical positivists](/wiki/Logical\_positivist "Logical positivist")
thought of scientific theories as \_deductive theories\_ â€”that a theory's
content is based on some [formal system](/wiki/Formal\_system "Formal system")
of logic and on basic [axioms](/wiki/Axioms "Axioms"). In a deductive theory,
any sentence which is a [logical consequence](/wiki/Logical\_consequence
"Logical consequence") of one or more of the axioms is also a sentence of that
theory.[11] This is called the [received view of
theories](/wiki/Received\_view\_of\_theories "Received view of theories").

In the [semantic view of theories](/wiki/Semantic\_view\_of\_theories "Semantic
view of theories"), which has largely replaced the received view,[18][19]
theories are viewed as [scientific models](/wiki/Scientific\_models "Scientific
models"). A [model](/wiki/Scientific\_model "Scientific model") is a logical
framework intended to represent reality (a "model of reality"), similar to the
way that a map is a graphical model that represents the territory of a city or
country. In this approach, theories are a specific category of models that
fulfill the necessary criteria. (See [Theories as
models](/wiki/Scientific\_theory#Theories\_as\_models "Scientific theory") for
further discussion.)
