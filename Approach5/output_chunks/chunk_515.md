 1. \*\*^\*\* \_i.e.\_ , invisible to the naked eye.
 2. \*\*^\*\* In the Capellan model only Mercury and Venus orbit the Sun, whilst in its extended version such as expounded by Riccioli, Mars also orbits the Sun, but the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn are centred on the Earth
 3. \*\*^\*\* In geostatic systems the apparent annual variation in the motion of sunspots could only be explained as the result of an implausibly complicated precession of the Sun's axis of rotation[71][72][73] This did not apply, however, to the modified version of Tycho's system introduced by his protégé, [Longomontanus](/wiki/Longomontanus "Longomontanus"), in which the Earth was assumed to rotate. Longomontanus's system could account for the apparent motions of sunspots just as well as the Copernican.
 4. ^ \_\*\*a\*\*\_ \_\*\*b\*\*\_ Such passages include [Psalm](/wiki/Psalms "Psalms") [93:1](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible\_\(World\_English\)/Psalms#Psalm\_93 "s:Bible \(World English\)/Psalms"), [96:10](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible\_\(World\_English\)/Psalms#Psalm\_96 "s:Bible \(World English\)/Psalms"), and [1 Chronicles](/wiki/Books\_of\_Chronicles "Books of Chronicles") [16:30](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible\_\(World\_English\)/1\_Chronicles#Chapter\_16 "s:Bible \(World English\)/1 Chronicles") which include text stating, "The world also is established. It can not be moved." In the same manner, [Psalm 104:5](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible\_\(World\_English\)/Psalms#Psalm\_104 "s:Bible \(World English\)/Psalms") says, "He (the Lord) laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be moved forever." Further, [Ecclesiastes](/wiki/Ecclesiastes "Ecclesiastes") [1:5](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible\_\(World\_English\)/Ecclesiastes#Chapter\_1 "s:Bible \(World English\)/Ecclesiastes") states, "The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its place where it rises", and [Joshua](/wiki/Book\_of\_Joshua "Book of Joshua") 10:14 states, "Sun, stand still on Gibeon...".[123]
 5. \*\*^\*\* The discovery of the [aberration of light](/wiki/Aberration\_\(astronomy\) "Aberration \(astronomy\)") by [James Bradley](/wiki/James\_Bradley "James Bradley") in January 1729 was the first conclusive evidence for the movement of the Earth, and hence for [Aristarchus](/wiki/Aristarchus\_of\_Samos "Aristarchus of Samos"), Copernicus and Kepler's theories; it was announced in January 1729.[124] The second evidence was produced by [Friedrich Bessel](/wiki/Friedrich\_Bessel "Friedrich Bessel") in 1838.
 6. \*\*^\*\* In Tycho's system, the stars were a little more distant than Saturn, and the Sun and stars were comparable in size.[125]
 7. \*\*^\*\* According to [Maurice Finocchiaro](/wiki/Maurice\_Finocchiaro "Maurice Finocchiaro"), this was done in a friendly and gracious manner, out of curiosity.[126]
 8. \*\*^\*\* Ingoli wrote that the great distance to the stars in the heliocentric theory "clearly proves ... the fixed stars to be of such size, as they may surpass or equal the size of the orbit circle of the Earth itself".[132]
 9. \*\*^\*\* Drake asserts that Simplicio's character is modelled on the Aristotelian philosophers Lodovico delle Colombe and [Cesare Cremonini](/wiki/Cesare\_Cremonini\_\(philosopher\) "Cesare Cremonini \(philosopher\)"), rather than Urban.[139] He also considers that the demand for Galileo to include the Pope's argument in the \_Dialogue\_ left him with no option but to put it in the mouth of Simplicio.[140] Even [Arthur Koestler](/wiki/Arthur\_Koestler "Arthur Koestler"), who is generally quite harsh on Galileo in \_[The Sleepwalkers](/wiki/The\_Sleepwalkers\_\(Koestler\_book\) "The Sleepwalkers \(Koestler book\)")\_ , after noting that Urban suspected Galileo of having intended Simplicio to be a caricature of him, says "this of course is untrue".[141]
