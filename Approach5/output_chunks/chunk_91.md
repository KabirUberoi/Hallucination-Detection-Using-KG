[![A complex mathematical surface in three

cubic](/wiki/Clebsch\_cubic "Clebsch cubic") is an example of a kind of
geometric object called an [algebraic variety](/wiki/Algebraic\_variety
"Algebraic variety"). A classical result of [enumerative
geometry](/wiki/Enumerative\_geometry "Enumerative geometry") states that there
are exactly 27 straight lines that lie entirely on this surface.

After Calabi–Yau manifolds had entered physics as a way to compactify extra
dimensions in string theory, many physicists began studying these manifolds.
In the late 1980s, several physicists noticed that given such a
compactification of string theory, it is not possible to reconstruct uniquely
a corresponding Calabi–Yau manifold.[90] Instead, two different versions of
string theory, type IIA and type IIB, can be compactified on completely
different Calabi–Yau manifolds giving rise to the same physics. In this
situation, the manifolds are called mirror manifolds, and the relationship
between the two physical theories is called [mirror
symmetry](/wiki/Mirror\_symmetry\_\(string\_theory\) "Mirror symmetry \(string
theory\)").[28]

Regardless of whether Calabi–Yau compactifications of string theory provide a
correct description of nature, the existence of the mirror duality between
different string theories has significant mathematical consequences. The
Calabi–Yau manifolds used in string theory are of interest in pure
mathematics, and mirror symmetry allows mathematicians to solve problems in
[enumerative geometry](/wiki/Enumerative\_geometry "Enumerative geometry"), a
branch of mathematics concerned with counting the numbers of solutions to
geometric questions.[28][91]

Enumerative geometry studies a class of geometric objects called [algebraic
varieties](/wiki/Algebraic\_varieties "Algebraic varieties") which are defined
by the vanishing of [polynomials](/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial"). For example,
the [Clebsch cubic](/wiki/Clebsch\_cubic "Clebsch cubic") illustrated on the
right is an algebraic variety defined using a certain polynomial of
[degree](/wiki/Degree\_of\_a\_polynomial "Degree of a polynomial") three in four
variables. A celebrated result of nineteenth-century mathematicians [Arthur
Cayley](/wiki/Arthur\_Cayley "Arthur Cayley") and [George
Salmon](/wiki/George\_Salmon "George Salmon") states that there are exactly 27
straight lines that lie entirely on such a surface.[92]

Generalizing this problem, one can ask how many lines can be drawn on a
quintic Calabi–Yau manifold, such as the one illustrated above, which is
defined by a polynomial of degree five. This problem was solved by the
nineteenth-century German mathematician [Hermann
Schubert](/wiki/Hermann\_Schubert "Hermann Schubert"), who found that there are
exactly 2,875 such lines. In 1986, geometer Sheldon Katz proved that the
number of curves, such as circles, that are defined by polynomials of degree
two and lie entirely in the quintic is 609,250.[93]

By the year 1991, most of the classical problems of enumerative geometry had
been solved and interest in enumerative geometry had begun to diminish.[94]
The field was reinvigorated in May 1991 when physicists [Philip
Candelas](/wiki/Philip\_Candelas "Philip Candelas"), [Xenia de la
Ossa](/wiki/Xenia\_de\_la\_Ossa "Xenia de la Ossa"), Paul Green, and Linda Parkes
showed that mirror symmetry could be used to translate difficult mathematical
questions about one Calabi–Yau manifold into easier questions about its
mirror.[95] In particular, they used mirror symmetry to show that a six-
dimensional Calabi–Yau manifold can contain exactly 317,206,375 curves of
degree three.[94] In addition to counting degree-three curves, Candelas and
his collaborators obtained a number of more general results for counting
rational curves which went far beyond the results obtained by
mathematicians.[96]

Originally, these results of Candelas were justified on physical grounds.
However, mathematicians generally prefer rigorous proofs that do not require
an appeal to physical intuition. Inspired by physicists' work on mirror
symmetry, mathematicians have therefore constructed their own arguments
proving the enumerative predictions of mirror symmetry.[e] Today mirror
symmetry is an active area of research in mathematics, and mathematicians are
working to develop a more complete mathematical understanding of mirror
symmetry based on physicists' intuition.[102] Major approaches to mirror
symmetry include the [homological mirror
symmetry](/wiki/Homological\_mirror\_symmetry "Homological mirror symmetry")
program of [Maxim Kontsevich](/wiki/Maxim\_Kontsevich "Maxim Kontsevich")[29]
and the [SYZ conjecture](/wiki/SYZ\_conjecture "SYZ conjecture") of Andrew
Strominger, Shing-Tung Yau, and [Eric Zaslow](/wiki/Eric\_Zaslow "Eric
Zaslow").[103]
