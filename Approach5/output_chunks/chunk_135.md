The primary use of game theory is to describe and
[model](/wiki/Conceptual\_model#Economic\_models "Conceptual model") how human
populations behave.[\_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed
"Wikipedia:Citation needed")\_]
Some[\_[who?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Words\_to\_watch#Unsupported\_attributions
"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")\_] scholars believe that by finding
the equilibria of games they can predict how actual human populations will
behave when confronted with situations analogous to the game being studied.
This particular view of game theory has been criticized. It is argued that the
assumptions made by game theorists are often violated when applied to real-
world situations. Game theorists usually assume players act rationally, but in
practice, human rationality and/or behavior often deviates from the model of
rationality as used in game theory. Game theorists respond by comparing their
assumptions to those used in [physics](/wiki/Physics "Physics"). Thus while
their assumptions do not always hold, they can treat game theory as a
reasonable scientific [ideal](/wiki/Idealization\_\(science\_philosophy\)
"Idealization \(science philosophy\)") akin to the models used by
[physicists](/wiki/Physicist "Physicist"). However, empirical work has shown
that in some classic games, such as the [centipede game](/wiki/Centipede\_game
"Centipede game"), [guess 2/3 of the average](/wiki/Guess\_2/3\_of\_the\_average
"Guess 2/3 of the average") game, and the [dictator game](/wiki/Dictator\_game
"Dictator game"), people regularly do not play Nash equilibria. There is an
ongoing debate regarding the importance of these experiments and whether the
analysis of the experiments fully captures all aspects of the relevant
situation.[b]

Some game theorists, following the work of John Maynard Smith and [George R.
Price](/wiki/George\_R.\_Price "George R. Price"), have turned to evolutionary
game theory in order to resolve these issues. These models presume either no
rationality or [bounded rationality](/wiki/Bounded\_rationality "Bounded
rationality") on the part of players. Despite the name, evolutionary game
theory does not necessarily presume [natural
selection](/wiki/Natural\_selection "Natural selection") in the biological
sense. Evolutionary game theory includes both biological as well as cultural
evolution and also models of individual learning (for example, [fictitious
play](/wiki/Fictitious\_play "Fictitious play") dynamics).
