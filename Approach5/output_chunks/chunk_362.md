### Scientific method[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Physics&action=edit&section=17
"Edit section: Scientific method")]

Physicists use the scientific method to test the validity of a [physical
theory](/wiki/Physical\_theory "Physical theory"). By using a methodical
approach to compare the implications of a theory with the conclusions drawn
from its related experiments and observations, physicists are better able to
test the validity of a theory in a logical, unbiased, and repeatable way. To
that end, experiments are performed and observations are made in order to
determine the validity or invalidity of a theory.[60]

A scientific law is a concise verbal or mathematical statement of a relation
that expresses a fundamental principle of some theory, such as Newton's law of
universal gravitation.[61]
