"In Theory" marked the directorial debut of cast member Patrick Stewart.[1]
Stewart sought the advice of fellow cast member Jonathan Frakes prior to
filming, as Frakes had already directed three episodes of \_The Next
Generation\_ , making Stewart the second cast member to do so.[1] Frakes
thought that Stewart did a good job, saying that "he was fabulous and took to
it beautifully".[3]

The story was written by [Joe Menosky](/wiki/Joe\_Menosky "Joe Menosky") and
[Ronald D. Moore](/wiki/Ronald\_D.\_Moore "Ronald D. Moore"), who were the
show's two executive story editors during season four.[3] The guest stars
included [Michele Scarabelli](/wiki/Michele\_Scarabelli "Michele Scarabelli"),
who had previously appeared as Susan on \_[Alien
Nation](/wiki/Alien\_Nation\_\(1989\_TV\_series\) "Alien Nation \(1989 TV
series\)")\_. [Pamela Winslow](/wiki/Pamela\_Winslow "Pamela Winslow") appeared
as Ensign McKnight, who had previously been referred to in the episode
"[Clues](/wiki/Clues\_\(Star\_Trek:\_The\_Next\_Generation\) "Clues \(Star Trek:
The Next Generation\)")" but not seen on screen.[1]
