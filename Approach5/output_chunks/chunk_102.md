 1. \*\*^\*\* For example, physicists are still working to understand the phenomenon of [quark confinement](/wiki/Quark\_confinement "Quark confinement"), the paradoxes of [black holes](/wiki/Black\_holes "Black holes"), and the origin of [dark energy](/wiki/Dark\_energy "Dark energy").
 2. \*\*^\*\* For example, in the context of the [AdS/CFT correspondence](/wiki/AdS/CFT\_correspondence "AdS/CFT correspondence"), theorists often formulate and study theories of gravity in unphysical numbers of spacetime dimensions.
 3. \*\*^\*\* ["Top Cited Articles during 2010 in hep-th"](http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/topcites/2010/eprints/to\_hep-th\_annual.shtml). Retrieved 25 July 2013.
 4. \*\*^\*\* More precisely, one cannot apply the methods of perturbative quantum field theory.
 5. \*\*^\*\* Two independent mathematical proofs of mirror symmetry were given by Givental[97][98] and Lian et al.[99][100][101]
 6. \*\*^\*\* More precisely, a nontrivial group is called \_[simple](/wiki/Simple\_group "Simple group")\_ if its only [normal subgroups](/wiki/Normal\_subgroup "Normal subgroup") are the [trivial group](/wiki/Trivial\_group "Trivial group") and the group itself. The [Jordan–Hölder theorem](/wiki/Jordan%E2%80%93H%C3%B6lder\_theorem "Jordan–Hölder theorem") exhibits finite simple groups as the building blocks for all finite groups.
