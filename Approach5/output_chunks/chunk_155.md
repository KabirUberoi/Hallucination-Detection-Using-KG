 \* Based on [the 1998 book](/wiki/A\_Beautiful\_Mind\_\(book\) "A Beautiful Mind \(book\)") by [Sylvia Nasar](/wiki/Sylvia\_Nasar "Sylvia Nasar"),[157] the life story of game theorist and mathematician [John Nash](/wiki/John\_Forbes\_Nash\_Jr. "John Forbes Nash Jr.") was turned into the 2001 [biopic](/wiki/Biopic "Biopic") \_[A Beautiful Mind](/wiki/A\_Beautiful\_Mind\_\(film\) "A Beautiful Mind \(film\)")\_ , starring [Russell Crowe](/wiki/Russell\_Crowe "Russell Crowe") as Nash.[158]
 \* The 1959 [military science fiction](/wiki/Military\_science\_fiction "Military science fiction") novel \_[Starship Troopers](/wiki/Starship\_Troopers "Starship Troopers")\_ by [Robert A. Heinlein](/wiki/Robert\_A.\_Heinlein "Robert A. Heinlein") mentioned "games theory" and "theory of games".[159] In the 1997 film [of the same name](/wiki/Starship\_Troopers\_\(film\) "Starship Troopers \(film\)"), the character Carl Jenkins referred to his military intelligence assignment as being assigned to "games and theory".
 \* The 1964 film \_[Dr. Strangelove](/wiki/Dr.\_Strangelove "Dr. Strangelove")\_ satirizes game theoretic ideas about [deterrence theory](/wiki/Deterrence\_theory "Deterrence theory"). For example, nuclear deterrence depends on the threat to retaliate catastrophically if a nuclear attack is detected. A game theorist might argue that such threats can fail to be \_credible\_ , in the sense that they can lead to subgame imperfect equilibria. The movie takes this idea one step further, with the Soviet Union irrevocably committing to a catastrophic nuclear response without making the threat public.[160]
 \* The 1980s [power pop](/wiki/Power\_pop "Power pop") band [Game Theory](/wiki/Game\_Theory\_\(band\) "Game Theory \(band\)") was founded by singer/songwriter [Scott Miller](/wiki/Scott\_Miller\_\(pop\_musician\) "Scott Miller \(pop musician\)"), who described the band's name as alluding to "the study of calculating the most appropriate action given an adversary ... to give yourself the minimum amount of failure".[161]
 \* \_[Liar Game](/wiki/Liar\_Game "Liar Game")\_ , a 2005 Japanese [manga](/wiki/Manga "Manga") and 2007 television series, presents the main characters in each episode with a game or problem that is typically drawn from game theory, as demonstrated by the strategies applied by the characters.[162]
 \* The 1974 novel \_[Spy Story](/wiki/Spy\_Story\_\(novel\) "Spy Story \(novel\)")\_ by [Len Deighton](/wiki/Len\_Deighton "Len Deighton") explores elements of game theory in regard to cold war army exercises.
 \* The 2008 novel \_[The Dark Forest](/wiki/The\_Dark\_Forest "The Dark Forest")\_ by [Liu Cixin](/wiki/Liu\_Cixin "Liu Cixin") explores the relationship between extraterrestrial life, humanity, and game theory.
 \* Joker, the prime antagonist in the 2008 film \_[The Dark Knight](/wiki/The\_Dark\_Knight "The Dark Knight")\_ presents game theory conceptsâ€”notably the [prisoner's dilemma](/wiki/Prisoner%27s\_dilemma "Prisoner's dilemma") in a scene where he asks passengers in two different ferries to bomb the other one to save their own.
 \* In the 2018 film \_[Crazy Rich Asians](/wiki/Crazy\_Rich\_Asians\_\(film\) "Crazy Rich Asians \(film\)")\_ , the female lead Rachel Chu is a professor of economics and game theory at [New York University](/wiki/New\_York\_University "New York University"). At the beginning of the film she is seen in her NYU classroom playing a game of poker with her teaching assistant and wins the game by [bluffing](/wiki/Glossary\_of\_card\_game\_terms#bluffing "Glossary of card game terms");[163] then in the [climax](/wiki/Climax\_\(narrative\) "Climax \(narrative\)") of the film, she plays a game of [mahjong](/wiki/Mahjong "Mahjong") with her boyfriend's disapproving mother Eleanor, losing the game to Eleanor on purpose but winning her approval as a result.[164]
 \* In the 2017 film [Molly's Game](/wiki/Molly%27s\_Game "Molly's Game"), Brad, an inexperienced poker player, makes an irrational betting decision without realising and causes his opponent Harlan to deviate from his Nash Equilibrium strategy, resulting in a significant loss when Harlan loses the hand.[165]
