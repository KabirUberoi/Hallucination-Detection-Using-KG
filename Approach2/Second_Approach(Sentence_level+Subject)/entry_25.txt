His father was Otto II, and his mother was Hedwig of Brandenburg.
He was a member of the House of Wettin.
His father did not intend to let Albert succeed him, preferring his younger brother Dietrich.
Albert did not accept this and started a war against his father and brother.
In 1188, he even took his father prisoner.
