### Compatibility with dark
energy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=String\_theory&action=edit&section=30 "Edit
section: Compatibility with dark energy")]

It remains unknown whether string theory is compatible with a metastable,
positive [cosmological constant](/wiki/Cosmological\_constant "Cosmological
constant"). Some putative examples of such solutions do exist, such as the
model described by Kachru \_et al\_. in 2003.[126] In 2018, a group of four
physicists advanced a controversial conjecture which would imply that [no such
universe exists](/wiki/Swampland\_\(physics\) "Swampland \(physics\)"). This is
contrary to some popular models of [dark energy](/wiki/Dark\_energy "Dark
energy") such as [Î›-CDM](/wiki/Lambda-CDM\_model "Lambda-CDM model"), which
requires a positive vacuum energy. However, string theory is likely compatible
with certain types of [quintessence](/wiki/Quintessence\_\(physics\)
"Quintessence \(physics\)"), where dark energy is caused by a new field with
exotic properties.[127]
