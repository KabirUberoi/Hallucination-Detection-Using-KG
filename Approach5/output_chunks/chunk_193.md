### Reducing

"Edit section: Reducing transmission")]

Public exposure to conspiracy theories can be reduced by interventions that
reduce their ability to spread, such as by encouraging people to reflect
before sharing a news story.[50] Researchers Carlos Diaz Ruiz and Tomas
Nilsson have proposed technical and rhetorical interventions to counter the
spread of conspiracy theories on social media.[99]

Interventions to counter the spread of conspiracy theories on social media[99] Type of intervention | Intervention 
---|--- 
Technical | Expose sources that insert and circulate conspiracy theories on social media (flagging). 
Diminish the source's capacity to monetize conspiracies (demonetization). 
Slow down the circulation of conspiracy theories (algorithm) 
Rhetorical | Issue authoritative corrections (fact-checking). 
Authority-based corrections and fact-checking may backfire because personal
worldviews cannot be proved wrong. 
Enlist spokespeople that can be perceived as allies and insiders. 
Rebuttals must spring from an epistemology that participants are already
familiar with. 
Give believers of conspiracies an "exit ramp" to dis-invest themselves without
facing ridicule.
