%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%GROUND_TRUTH%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Ground Truth : 

Mahamarakkala Kurukulasooriya Patabendige Akila Dananjaya Perera (born 4 October 1993 in Panadura, Western Province) is a Sri Lankan cricketer.
The son of a carpenter from Panadura, Dananjaya is another installment of Sri Lanka's long line of unorthodox spinners.
Officially a left-hand batsman and an off-break bowler, he is said to have seven variations, including the leg-break, googly, carrom ball, doosra, and his stock off-spinner that had impressed national team captain Mahela Jayawardene so much in the nets as to make Jayawardene request him to be fast-tracked into the national squad.
Dananjaya had at that point played no first-class, List A, T20, or even U-19 cricket.
This in turn led to controversy as his selection was questioned by the media on the basis of a net performance.
He was selected to play for Wayamba United in the inaugural Sri Lanka Premier League.
In only his second match for the franchise, he took 3-18 against Nagenahira Nagas, consistently disturbing the batsmen with his flight, googly, and other variations.
This in turn led to a place in the final squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20.
In the 2013 IPL auctions, Dananjaya was sold to the Chennai Super Kings for his base price of 20,000.
