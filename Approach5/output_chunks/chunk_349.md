world](/wiki/Physics\_in\_the\_medieval\_Islamic\_world "Physics in the medieval
Islamic world")

The [Western Roman Empire](/wiki/Western\_Roman\_Empire "Western Roman Empire")
fell in the fifth century, and this resulted in a decline in intellectual
pursuits in the western part of Europe. By contrast, the Eastern Roman Empire
(usually known as the [Byzantine Empire](/wiki/Byzantine\_Empire "Byzantine
Empire")) resisted the attacks from the barbarians, and continued to advance
various fields of learning, including physics.[16]

In the sixth century, [Isidore of Miletus](/wiki/Isidore\_of\_Miletus "Isidore
of Miletus") created an important compilation of [Archimedes](/wiki/Archimedes
"Archimedes")' works that are copied in the [Archimedes
Palimpsest](/wiki/Archimedes\_Palimpsest "Archimedes Palimpsest").

al-Haytham") (c. 965 – c. 1040) wrote of his \_camera obscura\_ experiments in
the \_Book of Optics\_.[17]

In sixth-century Europe [John Philoponus](/wiki/John\_Philoponus "John
Philoponus"), a Byzantine scholar, questioned [Aristotle](/wiki/Aristotle
"Aristotle")'s teaching of physics and noted its flaws. He introduced the
[theory of impetus](/wiki/Theory\_of\_impetus "Theory of impetus"). Aristotle's
physics was not scrutinized until Philoponus appeared; unlike Aristotle, who
based his physics on verbal argument, Philoponus relied on observation. On
Aristotle's physics Philoponus wrote:

Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as an
inspiration for [Galileo Galilei](/wiki/Galileo\_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") ten
centuries later,[19] during the [Scientific
Revolution](/wiki/Scientific\_Revolution "Scientific Revolution"). Galileo
cited Philoponus substantially in his works when arguing that Aristotelian
physics was flawed.[20][21] In the 1300s [Jean Buridan](/wiki/Jean\_Buridan
"Jean Buridan"), a teacher in the faculty of arts at the [University of
Paris](/wiki/University\_of\_Paris "University of Paris"), developed the concept
of impetus. It was a step toward the modern ideas of inertia and momentum.[22]

[Islamic scholarship](/wiki/Science\_in\_the\_medieval\_Islamic\_world "Science in
the medieval Islamic world") inherited [Aristotelian
physics](/wiki/Aristotelian\_physics "Aristotelian physics") from the Greeks
and during the [Islamic Golden Age](/wiki/Islamic\_Golden\_Age "Islamic Golden
Age") developed it further, especially placing emphasis on observation and \_[a
priori](/wiki/A\_priori\_and\_a\_posteriori "A priori and a posteriori")\_
reasoning, developing early forms of the [scientific
method](/wiki/Scientific\_method "Scientific method").

Although [Aristotle's principles of physics](/wiki/Physics\_\(Aristotle\)
"Physics \(Aristotle\)") was criticized, it is important to identify the
evidence upon which he based his views. careful study of the history of
science and math reveals the contributions made by older scientists.
Aristotle's science was the backbone of the science taught in schools today.
Aristotle published many biological works including \_[The Parts of
Animals](/wiki/Parts\_of\_Animals "Parts of Animals"),\_ in which he discusses
both biological science and natural science. Aristotle played an important
role in the progression of physics and metaphysics, and his beliefs and
findings are still taught in science classes today. The explanations that
Aristotle gives for his findings are also simple.

When thinking of the elements, Aristotle believed that each of the four
[classical elements](/wiki/Classical\_element "Classical element") (earth,
fire, water, air) had its own natural place.[23] Because of their differing
densities, each element will revert to its own specific place in the
atmosphere.[24] So, because of their weights, fire would be at the top, air
underneath fire, then water, then lastly earth. He also stated that when a
small amount of one element enters the natural place of another, the less
abundant element will automatically go towards its own natural place. For
example, if there is a fire on the ground, the flames go up into the air as an
attempt to go back into its natural place where it belongs. Aristotle called
his [metaphysics](/wiki/Metaphysics\_\(Aristotle\) "Metaphysics \(Aristotle\)")
"first philosophy" and characterized it as the study of "being as being".[25]
Aristotle defined the paradigm of motion as a being or entity encompassing
different areas in the same body.[25] Thus, a person who is at a location (A)
can move to a new location (B) and still take up the same amount of space.
This is involved with Aristotle's belief that motion is a continuum. In terms
of matter, Aristotle believed that the change in category (e.g. place) and
quality (e.g. color) of an object is defined as "alteration". But, a change in
substance is a change in matter. This is also similar to the idea of matter
today.

He also devised his own laws of motion that include 1) heavier objects will
fall faster, the speed being proportional to the weight and 2) the speed of
the object that is falling depends inversely on the density object it is
falling through (e.g. density of air).[26] He also stated that, when it comes
to violent motion (motion of an object when a force is applied to it by a
second object) that the speed that object moves, will only be as fast or
strong as the measure of force applied to it.[26] This is also seen in the
rules of velocity and force that is taught in physics classes today. These
rules are not necessarily what is described in physics today but, they are
mostly similar. It is evident that these rules were the backbone for other
scientists to revise and edit his beliefs.

The most notable innovations under Islamic scholarship were in the field of
[optics](/wiki/Optics "Optics") and vision,[27] which came from the works of
many scientists like [Ibn Sahl](/wiki/Ibn\_Sahl\_\(mathematician\) "Ibn Sahl
\(mathematician\)"), [Al-Kindi](/wiki/Al-Kindi "Al-Kindi"), [Ibn al-
Haytham](/wiki/Ibn\_al-Haytham "Ibn al-Haytham"), [Al-
Farisi](/wiki/Kam%C4%81l\_al-D%C4%ABn\_al-F%C4%81ris%C4%AB "Kamāl al-Dīn al-
Fārisī") and [Avicenna](/wiki/Avicenna "Avicenna"). The most notable work was
\_[The Book of Optics](/wiki/Book\_of\_Optics "Book of Optics")\_ (also known as
Kitāb al-Manāẓir), written by Ibn al-Haytham, in which he presented the
alternative to the ancient Greek idea about vision.[\_[citation
needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\_] In his
\_Treatise on Light\_ as well as in his \_Kitāb al-Manāẓir\_ , he presented a
study of the phenomenon of the [camera obscura](/wiki/Camera\_obscura "Camera
obscura") (his thousand-year-old version of the [pinhole
camera](/wiki/Pinhole\_camera "Pinhole camera")) and delved further into the
way the eye itself works. Using the knowledge of previous scholars, he began
to explain how light enters the eye. He asserted that the light ray is
focused, but the actual explanation of how light projected to the back of the
eye had to wait until 1604. His \_Treatise on Light\_ explained the camera
obscura, hundreds of years before the modern development of photography.[28]

The seven-volume \_Book of Optics\_ (\_Kitab al-Manathir\_) influenced
thinking[29] across disciplines from the theory of visual
[perception](/wiki/Perception "Perception") to the nature of
[perspective](/wiki/Perspectivity "Perspectivity") in medieval art, in both
the East and the West, for more than 600 years. This included later European
scholars and fellow polymaths, from [Robert
Grosseteste](/wiki/Robert\_Grosseteste "Robert Grosseteste") and [Leonardo da
Vinci](/wiki/Leonardo\_da\_Vinci "Leonardo da Vinci") to [Johannes
Kepler](/wiki/Johannes\_Kepler "Johannes Kepler").

The translation of \_The Book of Optics\_ had an impact on Europe. From it,
later European scholars were able to build devices that replicated those Ibn
al-Haytham had built and understand the way vision works.
