 \* [Jim Parsons](/wiki/Jim\_Parsons "Jim Parsons") as [Sheldon Cooper](/wiki/Sheldon\_Cooper "Sheldon Cooper"):[7] Originally from [Galveston, Texas](/wiki/Galveston,\_Texas "Galveston, Texas"), Sheldon was a child prodigy with an [eidetic memory](/wiki/Eidetic\_memory "Eidetic memory") who began college at the age of eleven and earned a Ph.D. at age sixteen. He is a [theoretical physicist](/wiki/Theoretical\_physics "Theoretical physics") researching [quantum mechanics](/wiki/Quantum\_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") and [string theory](/wiki/String\_theory "String theory"), and, despite his IQ of 187, he finds many routine aspects of social situations difficult to grasp. He is determined to have his own way, continually boasts of his intelligence, and has an extremely ritualized way of living. Despite these quirks, he begins a relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler, and they eventually marry.
 \* [Kaley Cuoco](/wiki/Kaley\_Cuoco "Kaley Cuoco") as [Penny](/wiki/Penny\_\(The\_Big\_Bang\_Theory\) "Penny \(The Big Bang Theory\)"):[8] An aspiring actress from [Omaha, Nebraska](/wiki/Omaha,\_Nebraska "Omaha, Nebraska").

Penny becomes friends with Bernadette and Amy, and they often hang out in each other's apartments. Penny and Leonard form a relationship and eventually marry.

Howard initially fancies himself as a ladies man, but he later starts dating Bernadette, and they get engaged and married.

Raj also has very feminine tastes and often takes on a stereotypical female role in his friendship with Howard as well as in the group of four men. Raj later dates Lucy ([Kate Micucci](/wiki/Kate\_Micucci "Kate Micucci")), who also suffers from social anxiety, but it eventually ends. He later speaks to Penny without alcohol, overcoming his selective mutism. He begins dating [Emily Sweeney](/wiki/List\_of\_The\_Big\_Bang\_Theory\_and\_Young\_Sheldon\_characters#Emily\_Sweeney "List of The Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon characters"), and their relationship later becomes exclusive.

A competent artist, Stuart is a graduate of the prestigious [Rhode Island School of Design](/wiki/Rhode\_Island\_School\_of\_Design "Rhode Island School of Design").

After Mrs. Wolowitz's death, Stuart continues to live in her home, along with Howard and Bernadette, until he finds a place of his own.

Their relationship becomes exclusive, but Raj later breaks up with Emily when he becomes infatuated with [Claire](/wiki/List\_of\_The\_Big\_Bang\_Theory\_and\_Young\_Sheldon\_characters#Claire "List of The Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon characters") ([Alessandra Torresani](/wiki/Alessandra\_Torresani "Alessandra Torresani")), a bartender and children's author.
