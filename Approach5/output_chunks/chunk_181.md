Conspiracy beliefs are widespread around the world.[47] In rural Africa,
common targets of conspiracy theorizing include societal elites, enemy tribes,
and the Western world, with conspirators often alleged to enact their plans
via sorcery or witchcraft; one common belief identifies modern technology as
itself being a form of sorcery, created with the goal of harming or
controlling the people.[47] In [China](/wiki/China "China"), one widely
published conspiracy theory claims that a number of events including the [rise
of Hitler](/wiki/Rise\_of\_Hitler "Rise of Hitler"), the [1997 Asian financial
crisis](/wiki/1997\_Asian\_financial\_crisis "1997 Asian financial crisis"), and
[climate change](/wiki/Climate\_change "Climate change") were planned by the
[Rothschild family](/wiki/Rothschild\_family "Rothschild family"), which may
have led to effects on discussions about [China's currency
policy](/wiki/Monetary\_policy\_of\_China "Monetary policy of China").[48][64]

Conspiracy theories once limited to fringe audiences have become commonplace
in [mass media](/wiki/Mass\_media "Mass media"), contributing to conspiracism
emerging as a [cultural phenomenon](/wiki/Cultural\_phenomenon "Cultural
phenomenon") in the United States of the late 20th and early 21st
centuries.[43][44][45][46] The general predisposition to believe conspiracy
theories cuts across partisan and ideological lines. Conspiratorial thinking
is correlated with antigovernmental orientations and a low sense of political
efficacy, with conspiracy believers perceiving a governmental threat to
individual rights and displaying a deep skepticism that who one votes for
really matters.[65]

Conspiracy theories are often commonly believed, some even being held by the
majority of the population.[47][48][49] A broad cross-section of Americans
today gives credence to at least some conspiracy theories.[66] For instance, a
study conducted in 2016 found that 10% of Americans think the [chemtrail
conspiracy theory](/wiki/Chemtrail\_conspiracy\_theory "Chemtrail conspiracy
theory") is "completely true" and 20–30% think it is "somewhat true".[67] This
puts "the equivalent of 120 million Americans in the 'chemtrails are real'
camp".[67] Belief in conspiracy theories has therefore become a topic of
interest for sociologists, psychologists and experts in
[folklore](/wiki/Folklore "Folklore").

Conspiracy theories are widely present on the [Web](/wiki/World\_Wide\_Web
"World Wide Web") in the form of [blogs](/wiki/Blog "Blog") and
[YouTube](/wiki/YouTube "YouTube") videos, as well as on [social
media](/wiki/Social\_media "Social media"). Whether the Web has increased the
prevalence of conspiracy theories or not is an open research question.[68] The
presence and representation of conspiracy theories in [search
engine](/wiki/Search\_engine "Search engine") results has been monitored and
studied, showing significant variation across different topics, and a general
absence of reputable, high-quality links in the results.[69]

One conspiracy theory that propagated through former US President Barack
Obama's time in office[70] claimed that he was [born in Kenya, instead of
Hawaii where he was actually
born](/wiki/Barack\_Obama\_citizenship\_conspiracy\_theories "Barack Obama
citizenship conspiracy theories").[71] Former governor of Arkansas and
political opponent of Obama [Mike Huckabee](/wiki/Mike\_Huckabee "Mike
Huckabee") made headlines in 2011[72] when he, among other members of
[Republican](/wiki/Republican\_Party\_\(United\_States\) "Republican Party
\(United States\)") leadership, continued to question Obama's citizenship
status.
