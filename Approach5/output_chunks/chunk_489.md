Galileo continued to receive visitors until his death on 8 January 1642, aged
77, following a fever and heart palpitations.[14][161] The Grand Duke of
Tuscany, [Ferdinando
II](/wiki/Ferdinando\_II\_de%27\_Medici,\_Grand\_Duke\_of\_Tuscany "Ferdinando II de'
Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany"), wished to bury him in the main body of the
[Basilica of Santa Croce](/wiki/Basilica\_di\_Santa\_Croce\_di\_Firenze "Basilica
di Santa Croce di Firenze"), next to the tombs of his father and other
ancestors, and to erect a marble mausoleum in his honour.[162][163]

These plans were dropped, however, after Pope Urban VIII and his nephew,
Cardinal Francesco Barberini, protested,[162][163][164] because Galileo had
been condemned by the Catholic Church for "vehement suspicion of heresy".[165]
He was instead buried in a small room next to the novices' chapel at the end
of a corridor from the southern transept of the basilica to the
sacristy.[162][166] He was reburied in the main body of the basilica in 1737
after a monument had been erected there in his honour;[167][168] during this
move, three fingers and a tooth were removed from his remains.[169] [One of
these fingers](/wiki/Galileo%27s\_middle\_finger "Galileo's middle finger") is
currently on exhibition at the [Museo Galileo](/wiki/Museo\_Galileo "Museo
Galileo") in Florence, Italy.[170]
