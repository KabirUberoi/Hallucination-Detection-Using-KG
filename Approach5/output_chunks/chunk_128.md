Mean field game theory is the study of strategic decision making in very large
populations of small interacting agents. This class of problems was considered
in the economics literature by [Boyan Jovanovic](/wiki/Boyan\_Jovanovic "Boyan
Jovanovic") and [Robert W. Rosenthal](/wiki/Robert\_W.\_Rosenthal "Robert W.
Rosenthal"), in the engineering literature by [Peter E.
Caines](/wiki/Peter\_E.\_Caines "Peter E. Caines"), and by mathematicians
[Pierre-Louis Lions](/wiki/Pierre-Louis\_Lions "Pierre-Louis Lions") and Jean-
Michel Lasry.
