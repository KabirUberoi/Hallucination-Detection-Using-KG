One of the fundamental properties of Einstein's general theory of relativity
is that it is [background independent](/wiki/Background\_independence
"Background independence"), meaning that the formulation of the theory does
not in any way privilege a particular spacetime geometry.[128]

One of the main criticisms of string theory from early on is that it is not
manifestly background-independent. In string theory, one must typically
specify a fixed reference geometry for spacetime, and all other possible
geometries are described as perturbations of this fixed one. In his book \_[The
Trouble With Physics](/wiki/The\_Trouble\_With\_Physics "The Trouble With
Physics")\_ , physicist [Lee Smolin](/wiki/Lee\_Smolin "Lee Smolin") of the
[Perimeter Institute for Theoretical
Physics](/wiki/Perimeter\_Institute\_for\_Theoretical\_Physics "Perimeter
Institute for Theoretical Physics") claims that this is the principal weakness
of string theory as a theory of quantum gravity, saying that string theory has
failed to incorporate this important insight from general relativity.[129]

Others have disagreed with Smolin's characterization of string theory. In a
review of Smolin's book, string theorist Joseph Polchinski writes

Polchinski notes that an important open problem in quantum gravity is to
develop holographic descriptions of gravity which do not require the
gravitational field to be asymptotically anti-de Sitter.[130] Smolin has
responded by saying that the AdS/CFT correspondence, as it is currently
understood, may not be strong enough to resolve all concerns about background
independence.[131]
