His theory of everything is (weakly) [emergentist](/wiki/Emergence
"Emergence") rather than [reductive](/wiki/Reductionism "Reductionism"). It
aims not at the reduction of everything to [particle
physics](/wiki/Particle\_physics "Particle physics"), but rather at mutual
support among multiverse, computational,
[epistemological](/wiki/Epistemological "Epistemological"), and evolutionary
principles.
