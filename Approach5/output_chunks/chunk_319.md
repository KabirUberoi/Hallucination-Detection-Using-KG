"Edit section: Reasons")]

Many cultures require proof of a bride's virginity prior to her marriage. This
has traditionally been tested by the presence of an intact [hymen](/wiki/Hymen
"Hymen"), which was verified by either a physical examination (usually by a
physician), who would provide a certificate of virginity or by a "proof of
blood", which refers to vaginal bleeding that results from the tearing of the
hymen.[21][22][23] The physical examination would normally be undertaken
before the marriage ceremony, while the "proof by blood" involves an
inspection for signs of bleeding as part of the [consummation of
marriage](/wiki/Consummation\_of\_marriage "Consummation of marriage"), after
the ceremony.
