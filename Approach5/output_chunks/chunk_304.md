In the poem \_[Grímnismál](/wiki/Gr%C3%ADmnism%C3%A1l "Grímnismál")\_ , Odin
(disguised as \_[Grímnir](/wiki/List\_of\_names\_of\_Odin "List of names of
Odin")\_) provides the young [Agnar](/wiki/Agnarr\_Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0sson "Agnarr
Geirröðsson") with cosmological lore. Yggdrasil is first mentioned in the poem
in stanza 29, where Odin says that, because the "[bridge of the
Æsir](/wiki/Bifr%C3%B6st "Bifröst") burns" and the "[sacred
waters](/wiki/Sacred\_waters "Sacred waters") boil," [Thor](/wiki/Thor "Thor")
must wade through the rivers [Körmt and Örmt](/wiki/K%C3%B6rmt\_and\_%C3%96rmt
"Körmt and Örmt") and two rivers named [Kerlaugar](/wiki/Kerlaugar
"Kerlaugar") to go "sit as judge at the ash of Yggdrasill". In the stanza that
follows, a [list of names of horses](/wiki/Horses\_of\_the\_%C3%86sir "Horses of
the Æsir") are given that the Æsir ride to "sit as judges" at Yggdrasil.[10]

In stanza 31, Odin says that the ash Yggdrasil has three roots that grow in
three directions. He details that beneath the first lives
[Hel](/wiki/Hel\_\(being\) "Hel \(being\)"), under the second live frost
jötnar, and beneath the third lives mankind. Stanza 32 details that a squirrel
named [Ratatoskr](/wiki/Ratatoskr "Ratatoskr") must run across Yggdrasil and
bring "the eagle's word" from above to Níðhöggr below. Stanza 33 describes
that four [harts](/wiki/Red\_deer "Red deer") named Dáinn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr and
Duraþrór consume "the highest boughs" of Yggdrasil.[10]

In stanza 34, Odin says that more serpents lie beneath Yggdrasil "than any
fool can imagine" and lists them as Góinn and Móinn (possibly meaning Old
Norse "land animal"[11]), which he describes as sons of Grafvitnir (Old Norse,
possibly "ditch wolf"[12]), Grábakr (Old Norse "Greyback"[11]), Grafvölluðr
(Old Norse, possibly "the one digging under the plain" or possibly amended as
"the one ruling in the ditch"[12]), Ófnir (Old Norse "the winding one, the
twisting one"[13]), and Sváfnir (Old Norse, possibly "the one who puts to
sleep = death"[14]), who Odin adds that he thinks will forever gnaw on the
tree's branches.[10]

In stanza 35, Odin says that Yggdrasil "suffers agony more than men know", as
a hart bites it from above, it decays on its sides, and Níðhöggr bites it from
beneath.[15] In stanza 44, Odin provides a list of things that are what he
refers to as the "noblest" of their kind. Within the list, Odin mentions
Yggdrasil first, and states that it is the "noblest of trees".[16]
