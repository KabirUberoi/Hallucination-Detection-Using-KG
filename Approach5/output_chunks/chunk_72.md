The application of quantum mechanics to physical objects such as the
[electromagnetic field](/wiki/Electromagnetic\_field "Electromagnetic field"),
which are extended in space and time, is known as [quantum field
theory](/wiki/Quantum\_field\_theory "Quantum field theory"). In particle
physics, quantum field theories form the basis for our understanding of
elementary particles, which are modeled as excitations in the fundamental
fields.[13]

In quantum field theory, one typically computes the probabilities of various
physical events using the techniques of [perturbation
theory](/wiki/Perturbation\_theory\_\(quantum\_mechanics\) "Perturbation theory
\(quantum mechanics\)"). Developed by [Richard Feynman](/wiki/Richard\_Feynman
"Richard Feynman") and others in the first half of the twentieth century,
perturbative quantum field theory uses special diagrams called [Feynman
diagrams](/wiki/Feynman\_diagram "Feynman diagram") to organize computations.
One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of point-like particles and
their interactions.[13]

The starting point for string theory is the idea that the point-like particles
of quantum field theory can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called
strings.[14] The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by
generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum field theory. At
the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the one-dimensional
diagram representing the path of a point particle by a two-dimensional (2D)
surface representing the motion of a string.[15] Unlike in quantum field
theory, string theory does not have a full non-perturbative definition, so
many of the theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain
out of reach.[16]

In theories of particle physics based on string theory, the characteristic
length scale of strings is assumed to be on the order of the [Planck
length](/wiki/Planck\_length "Planck length"), or 10−35 meters, the scale at
which the effects of quantum gravity are believed to become significant.[15]
On much larger length scales, such as the scales visible in physics
laboratories, such objects would be indistinguishable from zero-dimensional
point particles, and the vibrational state of the string would determine the
type of particle. One of the vibrational states of a string corresponds to the
graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries the gravitational
force.[3]

The original version of string theory was [bosonic string
theory](/wiki/Bosonic\_string\_theory "Bosonic string theory"), but this version
described only [bosons](/wiki/Bosons "Bosons"), a class of particles that
transmit forces between the matter particles, or [fermions](/wiki/Fermions
"Fermions"). Bosonic string theory was eventually superseded by theories
called [superstring theories](/wiki/Superstring\_theory "Superstring theory").
These theories describe both bosons and fermions, and they incorporate a
theoretical idea called [supersymmetry](/wiki/Supersymmetry "Supersymmetry").
In theories with supersymmetry, each boson has a counterpart which is a
fermion, and vice versa.[17]

There are several versions of superstring theory: [type I](/wiki/Type\_I\_string
"Type I string"), [type IIA](/wiki/Type\_IIA\_string "Type IIA string"), [type
IIB](/wiki/Type\_IIB\_string "Type IIB string"), and two flavors of [heterotic
string](/wiki/Heterotic\_string "Heterotic string") theory
([\_SO\_(32)](/wiki/Special\_orthogonal\_group "Special orthogonal group") and
[\_E\_ 8× \_E\_ 8](/wiki/E8\_\(mathematics\) "E8 \(mathematics\)")). The different
theories allow different types of strings, and the particles that arise at low
energies exhibit different [symmetries](/wiki/Symmetry\_\(physics\) "Symmetry
\(physics\)"). For example, the type I theory includes both open strings
(which are segments with endpoints) and closed strings (which form closed
loops), while types IIA, IIB and heterotic include only closed strings.[18]
