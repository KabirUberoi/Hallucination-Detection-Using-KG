Differential games such as the continuous [pursuit and evasion
game](/wiki/Pursuit-evasion "Pursuit-evasion") are continuous games where the
evolution of the players' state variables is governed by [differential
equations](/wiki/Differential\_equation "Differential equation"). The problem
of finding an optimal strategy in a differential game is closely related to
the [optimal control](/wiki/Optimal\_control "Optimal control") theory. In
particular, there are two types of strategies: the open-loop strategies are
found using the [Pontryagin maximum
principle](/wiki/Pontryagin%27s\_Minimum\_Principle "Pontryagin's Minimum
Principle") while the closed-loop strategies are found using [Bellman's
Dynamic Programming](/wiki/Hamilton%E2%80%93Jacobi%E2%80%93Bellman\_equation
"Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation") method.

A particular case of differential games are the games with a random [time
horizon](/wiki/Time\_horizon "Time horizon").[38] In such games, the terminal
time is a random variable with a given [probability
distribution](/wiki/Probability\_distribution "Probability distribution")
function. Therefore, the players maximize the [mathematical
expectation](/wiki/Mathematical\_expectation "Mathematical expectation") of the
cost function. It was shown that the modified optimization problem can be
reformulated as a discounted differential game over an infinite time interval.
