%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%GROUND_TRUTH%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Ground Truth : 

Mackenzie Caquatto (born March 26, 1992) is an American artistic gymnast.
She was formerly on the US National Team.
Her younger sister, Bridgette Caquatto, was also an elite gymnast on the senior US National Team.
She first qualified as an elite gymnast in 2007 and competed at the 2007 US National Championships, where she finished 17th.
Mackenzie competed as a senior for the first time at the 2008 US National Championships and placed 10th overall.
She was selected to be a member of her first national team and qualified for the 2008 US Olympic Team Trials, but competed only on the first day of competition, placing 12th in the all-around on that day.
In 2009, Caquatto competed at her first international meets as a member of the national team.
Caquatto suffered a knee injury shortly after, but managed to place 5th at the 2009 US National Championships.
She was then invited to the World Championships Selection Camp and was named as the first alternate for the team.
In addition to her status as an alternate, she was sent to the Toyota International in Toyota City, Japan.
At this competition, she competed on the uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise, winning the silver medal on the uneven bars with a score of 14.675, only behind world silver medalist on the event, Koko Tsurumi of Japan.
Caquatto started her 2010 season by competing at the City of Jesolo Trophy, where she had the highest beam score but made mistakes on the floor which kept her from medaling in the all-around.
Caquatto competed at the 2010 CoverGirl Classic and placed 3rd in the all-around, scoring the second highest on vault and the uneven bars but falling from the balance beam.
She had qualified to compete at the 2010 US National Championships.
At the 2010 US National Championships, Mackenzie placed 5th in the all-around.
She fell on a simple change grip skill on the uneven bars, her best event, placing 4th.

From there, she advanced to the second camp where she won the all-around competition.
She was eventually selected to compete.
At the World Championships, Mackenzie competed in the all-around in the qualifying round.
After hitting all her routines without major error, she placed 9th individually and 3rd with the team.
Although the top 24 qualifiers advance to the individual all-around final, she was left out because fellow American athletes Aly Raisman and Rebecca Bross had qualified ahead of her and only two athletes from each country can qualify to a final.
After the qualifying round, Mackenzie was selected to compete on the uneven bars and the vault during the team finals.
She contributed a 14.666 on the bars and a 15.000 on the vault to help the team win the silver medal behind Russia and ahead of China.

At the classic, she competed a slightly watered down balance beam routine and a solid uneven bars routine, scoring 14.100 and 14.750, respectively.
At the 2011 US Visa National Championships, Mackenzie surprised many by competing in the all-around.
On day 1 of the competition, Mackenzie was in second place after the two rotations after scoring a 14.700 and 15.000 on vault and uneven bars, respectively.
Unfortunately, she counted her first fall on the balance beam.
After having a solid floor exercise, she finished her night in sixth place with an all-around score of 56.000.
On the final day of competition, Mackenzie competed solidly on all her events.
Taking advantage of injuries to defending national champion Rebecca Bross and Chellsie Memmel, Mackenzie went on to finish the championships in fourth place behind Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, and champion Jordyn Wieber.
She also took second place on the uneven bars just behind Wieber by 0.050.
Mackenzie was given a spot on her fourth national team and was invited to compete at the first World Team Selection Camp.
She was considered to be a likely pick for the World Team, but injured her ankles when dismounting the beam at the selection camp and therefore lost her chance of going to Tokyo.
After sitting out the beginning of the NCAA season, she competed on the uneven bars in early 2012 and is expected to reintroduce her beam routine soon.
