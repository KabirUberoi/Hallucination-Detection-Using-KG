The Cournot competition model involves players choosing quantity of a
homogenous product to produce independently and simultaneously, where
[marginal cost](/wiki/Marginal\_cost "Marginal cost") can be different for each
firm and the firm's payoff is profit. The production costs are public
information and the firm aims to find their profit-maximizing quantity based
on what they believe the other firm will produce and behave like monopolies.
In this game firms want to produce at the monopoly quantity but there is a
high incentive to deviate and produce more, which decreases the market-
clearing price.[23] For example, firms may be tempted to deviate from the
monopoly quantity if there is a low monopoly quantity and high price, with the
aim of increasing production to maximize profit.[23] However this option does
not provide the highest payoff, as a firm's ability to maximize profits
depends on its market share and the elasticity of the market demand.[155] The
Cournot equilibrium is reached when each firm operates on their reaction
function with no incentive to deviate, as they have the best response based on
the other firms output.[23] Within the game, firms reach the Nash equilibrium
when the Cournot equilibrium is achieved.
