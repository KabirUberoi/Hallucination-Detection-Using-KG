"Edit section: Vanity cards")]

Like most shows created by Chuck Lorre, \_The Big Bang Theory\_ ends by showing
for one second a [vanity card](/wiki/Vanity\_card "Vanity card") written by
Lorre after the credits, followed by the Warner Bros. Television closing logo.
These cards are archived on Lorre's website.[94] The series' final vanity card
reads simply "The End".[95]
