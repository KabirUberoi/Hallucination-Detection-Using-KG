## Prevalence[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Child-on-
child\_sexual\_abuse&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Prevalence")]

Research estimates that over half of child sexual abuse offenses in the United
States are committed by perpetrators under the age of 18.[12] However, child-
on-child sexual abuse frequently goes unreported because it is not widely
known about by the public,[2] and often occurs outside of adults' supervision.
Even if known by adults, it is sometimes dismissed as harmless by those who do
not understand the implications.[2] In particular, inter-sibling abuse is
under-reported relative to the reporting rates for parentâ€“child sexual
abuse,[3] and disclosure of the [incest](/wiki/Incest "Incest") by the victim
during childhood is rare.[4]
