### Time evolution of a quantum
state[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Quantum\_mechanics&action=edit&section=3 "Edit
section: Time evolution of a quantum state")]

The time evolution of a quantum state is described by the Schrödinger
equation:

 i ℏ ∂ ∂ t ψ ( t ) = H ψ ( t ) . {\displaystyle i\hbar {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\psi (t)=H\psi (t).} ![{\\displaystyle i\\hbar {\\frac {\\partial }{\\partial t}}\\psi \(t\)=H\\psi \(t\).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/5c41b5a62afa3aa83e6ea98e69d692ac0f77c2c6)

Here H {\displaystyle H} ![{\\displaystyle
H}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b)
denotes the [Hamiltonian](/wiki/Hamiltonian\_\(quantum\_mechanics\) "Hamiltonian
\(quantum mechanics\)"), the observable corresponding to the [total
energy](/wiki/Total\_energy "Total energy") of the system, and ℏ
{\displaystyle \hbar } ![{\\displaystyle \\hbar
}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/de68de3a92517953436c93b5a76461d49160cc41)
is the reduced [Planck constant](/wiki/Planck\_constant "Planck constant"). The
constant i ℏ {\displaystyle i\hbar } ![{\\displaystyle i\\hbar
}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/3d724d600903f701570a9f97c2a8378a6f3a80e5)
is introduced so that the Hamiltonian is reduced to the [classical
Hamiltonian](/wiki/Hamiltonian\_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics") in cases
where the quantum system can be approximated by a classical system; the
ability to make such an approximation in certain limits is called the
[correspondence principle](/wiki/Correspondence\_principle "Correspondence
principle").

The solution of this differential equation is given by

 ψ ( t ) = e − i H t / ℏ ψ ( 0 ) . {\displaystyle \psi (t)=e^{-iHt/\hbar }\psi (0).} ![{\\displaystyle \\psi \(t\)=e^{-iHt/\\hbar }\\psi \(0\).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/3b0a822b842f8d952c4e5827f312597e72a45f4d)

The operator U ( t ) = e − i H t / ℏ {\displaystyle U(t)=e^{-iHt/\hbar }}
![{\\displaystyle U\(t\)=e^{-iHt/\\hbar
}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/17a17e78953fa7d61788cc8bc41a25ef254fc8e0)
is known as the time-evolution operator, and has the crucial property that it
is [unitary](/wiki/Unitarity\_\(physics\) "Unitarity \(physics\)"). This time
evolution is [deterministic](/wiki/Determinism "Determinism") in the sense
that – given an initial quantum state ψ ( 0 ) {\displaystyle \psi (0)}
![{\\displaystyle \\psi
\(0\)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/fcfdf3fefa6feee8b2192815ac15a2650d8a8db2)
– it makes a definite prediction of what the quantum state ψ ( t )
{\displaystyle \psi (t)} ![{\\displaystyle \\psi
\(t\)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/6cf4a36b5f945be90a527b3dbe3d55d3f0439cdb)
will be at any later time.[21]

densities](/wiki/Probability\_density\_function "Probability density function")
corresponding to the wave functions of an electron in a hydrogen atom
possessing definite energy levels (increasing from the top of the image to the
bottom: \_n\_ = 1, 2, 3, ...) and angular momenta (increasing across from left
to right: \_s\_ , \_p\_ , \_d\_ , ...). Denser areas correspond to higher
probability density in a position measurement. Such wave functions are
directly comparable to [Chladni's figures](/wiki/Chladni%27s\_figures
"Chladni's figures") of [acoustic](/wiki/Acoustics "Acoustics") modes of
vibration in classical physics and are modes of oscillation as well,
possessing a sharp [energy](/wiki/Energy "Energy") and thus, a definite
[frequency](/wiki/Frequency "Frequency"). The [angular
momentum](/wiki/Angular\_momentum "Angular momentum") and energy are
[quantized](/wiki/Quantization\_\(physics\) "Quantization \(physics\)") and
take \*\*only\*\* discrete values like those shown. (As is the case for [resonant
frequencies](/wiki/Resonant\_frequency "Resonant frequency") in acoustics.)

Some wave functions produce probability distributions that are independent of
time, such as [eigenstates of the Hamiltonian](/wiki/Eigenstate
"Eigenstate").[7]: 133–137 Many systems that are treated dynamically in
classical mechanics are described by such "static" wave functions. For
example, a single electron in an unexcited [atom](/wiki/Atom "Atom") is
pictured classically as a particle moving in a circular trajectory around the
[atomic nucleus](/wiki/Atomic\_nucleus "Atomic nucleus"), whereas in quantum
mechanics, it is described by a static wave function surrounding the nucleus.
For example, the electron wave function for an unexcited hydrogen atom is a
spherically symmetric function known as an [\_s\_ orbital](/wiki/Atomic\_orbital
"Atomic orbital") ([Fig. 1](/wiki/File:Atomic-orbital-clouds\_spd\_m0.png
"File:Atomic-orbital-clouds spd m0.png")).

Analytic solutions of the Schrödinger equation are known for [very few
relatively simple model Hamiltonians](/wiki/List\_of\_quantum-
mechanical\_systems\_with\_analytical\_solutions "List of quantum-mechanical
systems with analytical solutions") including the [quantum harmonic
oscillator](/wiki/Quantum\_harmonic\_oscillator "Quantum harmonic oscillator"),
the [particle in a box](/wiki/Particle\_in\_a\_box "Particle in a box"), the
[dihydrogen cation](/wiki/Dihydrogen\_cation "Dihydrogen cation"), and the
[hydrogen atom](/wiki/Hydrogen\_atom "Hydrogen atom"). Even the
[helium](/wiki/Helium "Helium") atom – which contains just two electrons – has
defied all attempts at a fully analytic treatment, admitting no solution in
[closed form](/wiki/Closed-form\_expression "Closed-form
expression").[22][23][24]

However, there are techniques for finding approximate solutions. One method,
called [perturbation theory](/wiki/Perturbation\_theory\_\(quantum\_mechanics\)
"Perturbation theory \(quantum mechanics\)"), uses the analytic result for a
simple quantum mechanical model to create a result for a related but more
complicated model by (for example) the addition of a weak [potential
energy](/wiki/Potential\_energy "Potential energy").[7]: 793 Another
approximation method applies to systems for which quantum mechanics produces
only small deviations from classical behavior. These deviations can then be
computed based on the classical motion.[7]: 849
