In the second stanza of the \_Poetic Edda\_ poem
\_[Völuspá](/wiki/V%C3%B6lusp%C3%A1 "Völuspá")\_ , the [völva](/wiki/V%C3%B6lva
"Völva") (a shamanic seeress) reciting the poem to the god Odin says that she
remembers far back to "early times", being raised by
[jötnar](/wiki/J%C3%B6tunn "Jötunn"), recalls [nine
worlds](/wiki/Norse\_cosmology "Norse cosmology") and nine \_ídiðiur\_ (rendered
in a variety of ways by translators—Dronke, for example, provides "nine wood-
ogresses"), and when Yggdrasil was a seed ("glorious tree of good measure,
under the ground").[2] In stanza 19, the völva says:

> An ash I know there stands, 
> Yggdrasill is its name, 
> a tall tree, showered 
> with shining [loam](/wiki/Loam "Loam"). 
> From there come the dews 
> that drop in the valleys. 
> It stands forever green over 
> [Urðr's well](/wiki/Ur%C3%B0arbrunnr "Urðarbrunnr").[3]

In stanza 20, the völva says that from the lake under the tree come three
"maidens deep in knowledge" named [Urðr](/wiki/Ur%C3%B0r "Urðr"),
[Verðandi](/wiki/Ver%C3%B0andi "Verðandi"), and [Skuld](/wiki/Skuld "Skuld").
The maidens "incised the slip of wood", "laid down laws" and "chose lives" for
the children of mankind and the destinies (\_\_[ørlǫg](/wiki/Wyrd "Wyrd")\_\_) of
men.[4] In stanza 27, the völva details that she is aware that
"[Heimdallr](/wiki/Heimdallr "Heimdallr")'s hearing is couched beneath the
bright-nurtured holy tree."[5] In stanza 45, Yggdrasil receives a final
mention in the poem. The völva describes, as a part of the onset of Ragnarök,
that Heimdallr blows [Gjallarhorn](/wiki/Gjallarhorn "Gjallarhorn"), that Odin
speaks with [Mímir](/wiki/M%C3%ADmir "Mímir")'s head, and then:

> Yggdrasill shivers, 
> the ash, as it stands. 
> The old tree groans, 
> and the giant slips free.[6]
