Galileo put forward [the basic principle of
relativity](/wiki/Galilean\_invariance "Galilean invariance"), that the laws of
physics are the same in any system that is moving at a constant speed in a
straight line, regardless of its particular speed or direction. Hence, there
is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic
framework for Newton's laws of motion and is central to Einstein's [special
theory of relativity](/wiki/Special\_theory\_of\_relativity "Special theory of
relativity").
