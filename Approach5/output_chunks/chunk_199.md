Some psychologists believe that a search for meaning is common in
conspiracism. Once cognized, [confirmation bias](/wiki/Confirmation\_bias
"Confirmation bias") and avoidance of [cognitive
dissonance](/wiki/Cognitive\_dissonance "Cognitive dissonance") may reinforce
the belief. In a context where a conspiracy theory has become embedded within
a social group, [communal reinforcement](/wiki/Communal\_reinforcement
"Communal reinforcement") may also play a part.[131]

Inquiry into possible motives behind the accepting of irrational conspiracy
theories has linked[132] these beliefs to distress resulting from an event
that occurred, such as the [events of 9/11.](/wiki/September\_11\_attacks
"September 11 attacks") Additional research suggests that "delusional
ideation" is the trait most likely to indicate a stronger belief in conspiracy
theories.[133] Research also shows an increased attachment to these irrational
beliefs leads to a decreased desire for civic engagement.[83] Belief in
conspiracy theories is correlated with low intelligence, lower analytical
thinking, [anxiety disorders](/wiki/Anxiety\_disorder "Anxiety disorder"),
[paranoia](/wiki/Paranoia "Paranoia"), and [authoritarian](/wiki/Authoritarian
"Authoritarian") beliefs.[134][135][136]

Professor [Quassim Cassam](/wiki/Quassim\_Cassam "Quassim Cassam") argues that
conspiracy theorists hold their beliefs due to flaws in their thinking and
more precisely, their intellectual character. He cites philosopher [Linda
Trinkaus Zagzebski](/wiki/Linda\_Trinkaus\_Zagzebski "Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski")
and her book \_Virtues of the Mind\_ in outlining intellectual virtues (such as
humility, caution and carefulness) and intellectual vices (such as
gullibility, carelessness and closed-mindedness). Whereas intellectual virtues
help in reaching sound examination, intellectual vices "impede effective and
responsible inquiry", meaning that those who are prone to believing in
conspiracy theories possess certain vices while lacking necessary
virtues.[137]

Some researchers have suggested that conspiracy theories could be partially
caused by psychological mechanisms the human brain possesses for detecting
dangerous coalitions. Such a mechanism could have been useful in the small-
scale environment humanity evolved in but are mismatched in a modern, complex
society and thus "misfire", perceiving conspiracies where none exist.[138]
