On 30 November 1609, Galileo aimed his telescope at the [Moon](/wiki/Moon
"Moon").[45] While not being the first person to observe the Moon through a
telescope (English mathematician [Thomas Harriot](/wiki/Thomas\_Harriot "Thomas
Harriot") had done it four months before but only saw a "strange
spottednesse"),[46] Galileo was the first to deduce the cause of the uneven
waning as light occlusion from lunar mountains and
[craters](/wiki/Impact\_crater "Impact crater"). In his study, he also made
topographical charts, estimating the heights of the mountains. The Moon was
not what was long thought to have been a translucent and perfect sphere, as
Aristotle claimed, and hardly the first "planet", an "eternal pearl to
magnificently ascend into the heavenly empyrian", as put forth by
[Dante](/wiki/Dante "Dante"). Galileo is sometimes credited with the discovery
of the [lunar libration in latitude](/wiki/Libration#Lunar\_libration
"Libration") in 1632,[47] although Thomas Harriot or [William
Gilbert](/wiki/William\_Gilbert\_\(astronomer\) "William Gilbert
\(astronomer\)") might have done it before.[48]

A friend of Galileo's, the painter Cigoli, included a realistic depiction of
the Moon in one of his paintings, though probably used his own telescope to
make the observation.[36]
