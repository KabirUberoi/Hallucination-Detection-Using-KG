"Edit section: Choosing a management style")]

For McGregor, Theory X and Theory Y are not opposite ends of the same
continuum, but rather two different continua in themselves. In order to
achieve the most efficient production, a combination of both theories may be
appropriate.[8] This approach is derived from Fred Fiedler's research over
various leadership styles known as the [contingency
theory](/wiki/Contingency\_theory "Contingency theory"). This theory states
that managers evaluate the workplace and choose their leadership style based
upon both internal and external conditions presented. Managers who choose the
Theory X approach have an authoritarian style of management. An organization
with this style of management is made up of several levels of supervisors and
managers who actively intervene and micromanage the employees. On the
contrary, managers who choose the Theory Y approach have a hands-off style of
management. An organization with this style of management encourages
participation and values individuals' thoughts and goals. However, because
there is no optimal way for a manager to choose between adopting either Theory
X or Theory Y, it is likely that a manager will need to adopt both approaches
depending on the evolving circumstances and levels of internal and external
locus of control throughout the workplace.[12]
