"Edit section: In captivity")]

The cassowary has solitary habits and breeds less frequently in zoos than
other ratites such as ostrich and emu. Unlike other ratites, it lives
exclusively in tropical rainforest, and reproducing this habitat carefully is
essential. Unlike the emu, which will live with other
[sympatric](/wiki/Sympatric "Sympatric") species, such as
[kangaroos](/wiki/Kangaroos "Kangaroos"), in "mixed Australian fauna"
displays, the cassowary does not cohabit well among its own kind. Individual
specimens must even be kept in separate enclosures, due to their solitary and
aggressive nature. Territoriality is one of their most important
characteristics.

The double-wattled cassowary (\_C. casuarius\_) is the most popular species in
captivity, and it is fairly common in European and American zoos, where it is
known for its unmistakable appearance. As of
2019[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cassowary&action=edit),
only [Weltvogelpark Walsrode](/wiki/Weltvogelpark\_Walsrode "Weltvogelpark
Walsrode") in Germany has all three species of cassowaries in its collection:
single-wattled cassowary (\_Casuarius unappendiculatus\_) and Bennett's
cassowary (\_Casuarius bennetti\_). If subspecies are recognised, Weltvogelpark
Walsrode has \_C. b. westermanni\_ and \_C. u. rufotinctus\_.
