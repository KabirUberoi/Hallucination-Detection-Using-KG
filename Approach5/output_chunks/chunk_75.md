In string theory and other related theories, a [brane](/wiki/Brane "Brane") is
a physical object that generalizes the notion of a point particle to higher
dimensions. For instance, a point particle can be viewed as a brane of
dimension zero, while a string can be viewed as a brane of dimension one. It
is also possible to consider higher-dimensional branes. In dimension \_p\_ ,
these are called \_p\_ -branes. The word brane comes from the word "membrane"
which refers to a two-dimensional brane.[27]

Branes are dynamical objects which can propagate through spacetime according
to the rules of quantum mechanics. They have mass and can have other
attributes such as charge. A \_p\_ -brane sweeps out a (\_p\_ +1)-dimensional
volume in spacetime called its \_worldvolume\_. Physicists often study
[fields](/wiki/Field\_\(physics\) "Field \(physics\)") analogous to the
electromagnetic field which live on the worldvolume of a brane.[27]

In string theory, [D-branes](/wiki/D-brane "D-brane") are an important class
of branes that arise when one considers open strings. As an open string
propagates through spacetime, its endpoints are required to lie on a D-brane.
The letter "D" in D-brane refers to a certain mathematical condition on the
system known as the [Dirichlet boundary
condition](/wiki/Dirichlet\_boundary\_condition "Dirichlet boundary condition").
The study of D-branes in string theory has led to important results such as
the AdS/CFT correspondence, which has shed light on many problems in quantum
field theory.[27]

Branes are frequently studied from a purely mathematical point of view, and
they are described as objects of certain
[categories](/wiki/Category\_\(mathematics\) "Category \(mathematics\)"), such
as the [derived category](/wiki/Derived\_category "Derived category") of
[coherent sheaves](/wiki/Coherent\_sheaf "Coherent sheaf") on a [complex
algebraic variety](/wiki/Complex\_algebraic\_variety "Complex algebraic
variety"), or the [Fukaya category](/wiki/Fukaya\_category "Fukaya category")
of a [symplectic manifold](/wiki/Symplectic\_manifold "Symplectic
manifold").[28] The connection between the physical notion of a brane and the
mathematical notion of a category has led to important mathematical insights
in the fields of [algebraic](/wiki/Algebraic\_geometry "Algebraic geometry")
and [symplectic geometry](/wiki/Symplectic\_geometry "Symplectic geometry")[29]
and [representation theory](/wiki/Representation\_theory "Representation
theory").[30]
