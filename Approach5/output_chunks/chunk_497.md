By the 17th century, water pump designs had improved to the point that they
produced measurable vacuums, but this was not immediately understood. What was
known was that suction pumps could not pull water beyond a certain height: 18
Florentine yards according to a measurement taken around 1635, or about 34
feet (10 m).[197] This limit was a concern in irrigation projects, mine
drainage, and decorative water fountains planned by the Duke of Tuscany, so
the duke commissioned Galileo to investigate the problem. In his \_Two New
Sciences\_ (1638) Galileo suggested, incorrectly, that the column of water
pulled up by a water pump would break of its own weight once reaching beyond
34 feet.[197]
