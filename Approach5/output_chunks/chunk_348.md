[Natural philosophy](/wiki/Natural\_philosophy "Natural philosophy") has its
origins in [Greece](/wiki/Greece "Greece") during the [Archaic
period](/wiki/Archaic\_Greece "Archaic Greece") (650 BCE â€“ 480 BCE), when [pre-
Socratic philosophers](/wiki/Presocratics "Presocratics") like
[Thales](/wiki/Thales "Thales") rejected [non-
naturalistic](/wiki/Methodological\_naturalism "Methodological naturalism")
explanations for natural phenomena and proclaimed that every event had a
natural cause.[13] They proposed ideas verified by reason and observation, and
many of their hypotheses proved successful in experiment;[14] for example,
[atomism](/wiki/Atomism "Atomism") was found to be correct approximately 2000
years after it was proposed by [Leucippus](/wiki/Leucippus "Leucippus") and
his pupil [Democritus](/wiki/Democritus "Democritus").[15]
