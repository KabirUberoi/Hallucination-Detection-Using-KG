While Galileo's application of mathematics to experimental physics was
innovative, his mathematical methods were the standard ones of the day,
including dozens of examples of an inverse proportion [square
root](/wiki/Square\_root "Square root") method passed down from
[Fibonacci](/wiki/Fibonacci "Fibonacci") and [Archimedes](/wiki/Archimedes
"Archimedes"). The analysis and proofs relied heavily on the [Eudoxian theory
of proportion](/wiki/Eudoxus\_of\_Cnidus#Mathematics "Eudoxus of Cnidus"), as
set forth in the fifth book of [Euclid's Elements](/wiki/Euclid%27s\_Elements
"Euclid's Elements"). This theory had become available only a century before,
thanks to accurate translations by [Tartaglia](/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2\_Tartaglia
"Niccolò Tartaglia") and others; but by the end of Galileo's life, it was
being superseded by the algebraic methods of
[Descartes](/wiki/Ren%C3%A9\_Descartes "René Descartes"). The concept now named
[Galileo's paradox](/wiki/Galileo%27s\_paradox "Galileo's paradox") was not
original with him. His proposed solution, that [infinite
numbers](/wiki/Infinite\_number "Infinite number") cannot be compared, is no
longer considered useful.[222]
