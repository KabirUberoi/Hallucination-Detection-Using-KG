## Representation of
games[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Game\_theory&action=edit&section=20 "Edit
section: Representation of games")]

The games studied in game theory are well-defined mathematical objects. To be
fully defined, a game must specify the following elements: the \_players\_ of
the game, the \_information\_ and \_actions\_ available to each player at each
decision point, and the [\_payoffs\_](/wiki/Utility "Utility") for each outcome.
(Eric Rasmusen refers to these four "essential elements" by the acronym
"PAPI".)[45][46][47][48] A game theorist typically uses these elements, along
with a [solution concept](/wiki/Solution\_concept "Solution concept") of their
choosing, to deduce a set of equilibrium
[strategies](/wiki/Strategy\_\(game\_theory\) "Strategy \(game theory\)") for
each player such that, when these strategies are employed, no player can
profit by unilaterally deviating from their strategy. These equilibrium
strategies determine an [equilibrium](/wiki/Economic\_equilibrium "Economic
equilibrium") to the gameâ€”a stable state in which either one outcome occurs or
a set of outcomes occur with known probability.

Most cooperative games are presented in the characteristic function form,
while the extensive and the normal forms are used to define noncooperative
games.
