%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%GROUND_TRUTH%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Ground Truth : 

Vitaliano Brancati (July 24, 1907 September 25, 1954) was an Italian novelist, dramatist, poet, and screenwriter.
Born in Pachino, Syracuse, Brancati studied in Catania, where he graduated in letters and where he spent the majority of his life.
Although he began writing at a young age and was already the author of six books at 25 years old, which were largely influenced by fascist ideals and later rejected by Brancati himself, critics tend to set the starting point of his career in 1935, when he released the collection of short stories In Search of a Cause.
Brancati achieved his first and probably most significant success in 1941 with the novel Don Giovanni in Sicily, a vibrant and humorous portrait of the Sicilian temperament.
In 1944 he wrote the novel Gli Anni Perduti (The Lost Years), a bold satire of Benito Mussolini's megalomania, and in 1946 Vecchio con gli Stivali (Old Man in Boots), a satirical short story inspired by the vicissitudes of Italian fascism, which won the Vendemmia Award and was adapted into a successful film, Difficult Years, by Luigi Zampa.
In 1950 he won the Bagutta Prize with another well-known novel, Il Bell'Antonio (The Handsome Antonio).
He died in a clinic in Turin after a major surgery.
He was married to actress Anna Proclemer.
