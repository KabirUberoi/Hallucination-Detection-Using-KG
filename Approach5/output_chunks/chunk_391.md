Other branches of physics also received attention during the period of the
Scientific Revolution. [William Gilbert](/wiki/William\_Gilbert\_\(astronomer\)
"William Gilbert \(astronomer\)"), court physician to [Queen Elizabeth
I](/wiki/Elizabeth\_I\_of\_England "Elizabeth I of England"), published an
important work on magnetism in 1600, describing how the earth itself behaves
like a giant magnet. [Robert Boyle](/wiki/Robert\_Boyle "Robert Boyle")
(1627â€“91) studied the behavior of gases enclosed in a chamber and formulated
the [gas law named for him](/wiki/Boyle%27s\_law "Boyle's law"); he also
contributed to physiology and to the founding of modern chemistry. Another
important factor in the scientific revolution was the rise of learned
societies and academies in various countries. The earliest of these were in
Italy and Germany and were short-lived. More influential were the [Royal
Society of England](/wiki/Royal\_Society\_of\_England "Royal Society of England")
(1660) and the [Academy of Sciences in
France](/wiki/Academy\_of\_Sciences\_\(France\) "Academy of Sciences \(France\)")
(1666). The former was a private institution in London and included such
scientists as [John Wallis](/wiki/John\_Wallis "John Wallis"), [William
Brouncker](/wiki/William\_Brouncker,\_2nd\_Viscount\_Brouncker "William Brouncker,
2nd Viscount Brouncker"), [Thomas Sydenham](/wiki/Thomas\_Sydenham "Thomas
Sydenham"), [John Mayow](/wiki/John\_Mayow "John Mayow"), and [Christopher
Wren](/wiki/Christopher\_Wren "Christopher Wren") (who contributed not only to
architecture but also to astronomy and anatomy); the latter, in Paris, was a
government institution and included as a foreign member the Dutchman Huygens.
In the 18th century, important royal academies were established at Berlin
(1700) and at St. Petersburg (1724). The societies and academies provided the
principal opportunities for the publication and discussion of scientific
results during and after the scientific revolution. In 1690, [James
Bernoulli](/wiki/James\_Bernoulli "James Bernoulli") showed that the
[cycloid](/wiki/Cycloid "Cycloid") is the solution to the tautochrone problem;
and the following year, in 1691, [Johann Bernoulli](/wiki/Johann\_Bernoulli
"Johann Bernoulli") showed that a chain freely suspended from two points will
form a [catenary](/wiki/Catenary "Catenary"), the curve with the lowest
possible [center of gravity](/wiki/Center\_of\_gravity "Center of gravity")
available to any chain hung between two fixed points. He then showed, in 1696,
that the cycloid is the solution to the
[brachistochrone](/wiki/Brachistochrone "Brachistochrone") problem.
