Many pre-modern societies placed great value on assessing the virginity of
their girls, as is attested in sources ranging from mythology to popular
literature, folklore, and official records.[7]

Prior to the advance of European medicine in the 15th century, the nature of
the hymen was not fully understood, and consequently a great variety of more
or less miraculous or scientific tests were advocated for.[7] The Incas of
Peru reserved their sacred "[Virgins of the Sun](/wiki/Aclla "Aclla")" as
brides for high status men, and when a girl was suspected of sexual activity,
she was made to blow into a smouldering fire; if the fire flared up, she was
deemed chaste.[8] In ancient Greece, a story related in the 5th century BC
tells how the god Pan could establish the purity of any girl, as his mystical
flute responded spontaneously to the presence of a virgin.[8]

The Medieval romances \_[Floris and Blancheflur](/wiki/Floris\_and\_Blancheflour
"Floris and Blancheflour")\_ (c. 1250) and \_[Bevis of
Hampton](/wiki/Bevis\_of\_Hampton "Bevis of Hampton")\_ (c. 1300) both feature
virgin heroines who must prove their purity and therefore their worth.[7][a]
The scenario was also acted out on the English stage, in plays such as
Middleton's [\_The Changeling\_](/wiki/The\_Changeling\_\(play\) "The Changeling
\(play\)") (1622).[9]
