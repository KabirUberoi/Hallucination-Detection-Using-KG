Cassowaries feed on the fruit of several hundred rainforest species and
usually pass viable seeds in large, dense [scats](/wiki/Feces "Feces"). They
are known to disperse seeds over distances greater than a kilometre, thus
playing an important role in the ecosystem. Germination rates for seeds of the
rare Australian rainforest tree \_[Ryparosa](/wiki/Ryparosa "Ryparosa")\_ were
found to be much higher after passing through a cassowary's gut (92% versus
4%).[57]
