 1. \*\*^\*\* [Francis Bacon](/wiki/Francis\_Bacon "Francis Bacon")'s 1620 \_[Novum Organum](/wiki/Novum\_Organum "Novum Organum")\_ was critical in the [development of scientific method](/wiki/History\_of\_scientific\_method "History of scientific method").[6]
 2. \*\*^\*\* Calculus was independently developed at around the same time by [Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](/wiki/Gottfried\_Wilhelm\_Leibniz "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz"); while Leibniz was the first to publish his work and develop much of the notation used for calculus today, Newton was the first to develop calculus and apply it to physical problems. See also [Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy](/wiki/Leibniz%E2%80%93Newton\_calculus\_controversy "Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy")
 3. \*\*^\*\* Noll notes that some universities still use this title.[39]
 4. \*\*^\*\* See, for example, the influence of [Kant](/wiki/Immanuel\_Kant "Immanuel Kant") and [Ritter](/wiki/Johann\_Wilhelm\_Ritter "Johann Wilhelm Ritter") on [Ørsted](/wiki/Hans\_Christian\_%C3%98rsted "Hans Christian Ørsted").
 5. \*\*^\*\* Concepts which are denoted \_hypothetical\_ can change with time. For example, the [atom](/wiki/Atom "Atom") of nineteenth-century physics was denigrated by some, including [Ernst Mach](/wiki/Ernst\_Mach "Ernst Mach")'s critique of [Ludwig Boltzmann](/wiki/Ludwig\_Boltzmann "Ludwig Boltzmann")'s formulation of [statistical mechanics](/wiki/Statistical\_mechanics "Statistical mechanics"). By the end of World War II, the atom was no longer deemed hypothetical.
 6. \*\*^\*\* Yet, universalism is encouraged in the culture of physics. For example, the [World Wide Web](/wiki/World\_Wide\_Web "World Wide Web"), which was innovated at [CERN](/wiki/CERN "CERN") by [Tim Berners-Lee](/wiki/Tim\_Berners-Lee "Tim Berners-Lee"), was created in service to the computer infrastructure of CERN, and was/is intended for use by physicists worldwide. The same might be said for [arXiv.org](/wiki/ArXiv.org "ArXiv.org")
 7. \*\*^\*\* See the work of [Ilya Prigogine](/wiki/Ilya\_Prigogine "Ilya Prigogine"), on 'systems far from equilibrium', and others.
