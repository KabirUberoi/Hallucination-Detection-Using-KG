"Edit section: Reception")]

In its review of \_Quantum Reality\_ , \_The New York Times\_ praised Herbert's
efforts at making the subject matter comprehensible to a lay audience.[3]
Physicist [Heinz Pagels](/wiki/Heinz\_Pagels "Heinz Pagels") called \_Quantum
Reality\_ "a great place for the general reader to begin to learn about quantum
physics".[4] \_[Kirkus Reviews](/wiki/Kirkus\_Reviews "Kirkus Reviews")\_ ,
however, concluded that \_Quantum Reality\_ , while engaging, may leave lay
readers confused.[5]

[Post-anarchist](/wiki/Post-anarchist "Post-anarchist") writer [Hakim
Bey](/wiki/Hakim\_Bey "Hakim Bey") used \_Quantum Reality\_ as the basis for an
analysis of the field of quantum physics in terms of the [social
paradigms](/wiki/Social\_paradigm "Social paradigm") that it may influence, and
from which it may draw its metaphors.[6]

Physicist [David Kaiser](/wiki/David\_Kaiser\_\(physicist\) "David Kaiser
\(physicist\)"), who has written about the [Fundamental Fysiks
Group](/wiki/Fundamental\_Fysiks\_Group "Fundamental Fysiks Group") to which
Herbert belonged, claims that the book is used in undergraduate physics
courses.[1]

\_Quantum Reality\_ has been translated into German, Japanese, and
Portuguese.[7]
