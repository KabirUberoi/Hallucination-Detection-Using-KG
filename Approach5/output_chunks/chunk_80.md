In the branch of physics called [statistical
mechanics](/wiki/Statistical\_mechanics "Statistical mechanics"),
[entropy](/wiki/Entropy "Entropy") is a measure of the randomness or disorder
of a physical system. This concept was studied in the 1870s by the Austrian
physicist [Ludwig Boltzmann](/wiki/Ludwig\_Boltzmann "Ludwig Boltzmann"), who
showed that the [thermodynamic](/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics")
properties of a [gas](/wiki/Gas "Gas") could be derived from the combined
properties of its many constituent [molecules](/wiki/Molecule "Molecule").
Boltzmann argued that by averaging the behaviors of all the different
molecules in a gas, one can understand macroscopic properties such as volume,
temperature, and pressure. In addition, this perspective led him to give a
precise definition of entropy as the [natural
logarithm](/wiki/Natural\_logarithm "Natural logarithm") of the number of
different states of the molecules (also called \_microstates\_) that give rise
to the same macroscopic features.[54]

In the twentieth century, physicists began to apply the same concepts to black
holes. In most systems such as gases, the entropy scales with the volume. In
the 1970s, the physicist [Jacob Bekenstein](/wiki/Jacob\_Bekenstein "Jacob
Bekenstein") suggested that the entropy of a black hole is instead
proportional to the \_surface area\_ of its [event horizon](/wiki/Event\_horizon
"Event horizon"), the boundary beyond which matter and radiation are lost to
its gravitational attraction.[55] When combined with ideas of the physicist
[Stephen Hawking](/wiki/Stephen\_Hawking "Stephen Hawking"),[56] Bekenstein's
work yielded a precise formula for the entropy of a black hole. The
[Bekenstein–Hawking formula](/wiki/Bekenstein%E2%80%93Hawking\_formula
"Bekenstein–Hawking formula") expresses the entropy \_S\_ as

 S = c 3 k A 4 ℏ G {\displaystyle S={\frac {c^{3}kA}{4\hbar G}}} ![{\\displaystyle S={\\frac {c^{3}kA}{4\\hbar G}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/2c639a5f58a5b4a80596ea50096d57ec867d6a9d)

where \_c\_ is the [speed of light](/wiki/Speed\_of\_light "Speed of light"), \_k\_
is the [Boltzmann constant](/wiki/Boltzmann\_constant "Boltzmann constant"),
\_ħ\_ is the [reduced Planck constant](/wiki/Reduced\_Planck\_constant "Reduced
Planck constant"), \_G\_ is [Newton's constant](/wiki/Newton%27s\_constant
"Newton's constant"), and \_A\_ is the surface area of the event horizon.[57]

Like any physical system, a black hole has an entropy defined in terms of the
number of different microstates that lead to the same macroscopic features.
The Bekenstein–Hawking entropy formula gives the expected value of the entropy
of a black hole, but by the 1990s, physicists still lacked a derivation of
this formula by counting microstates in a theory of quantum gravity. Finding
such a derivation of this formula was considered an important test of the
viability of any theory of quantum gravity such as string theory.[58]
