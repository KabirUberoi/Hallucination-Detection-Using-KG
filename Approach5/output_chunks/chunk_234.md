## Military command and

"Edit section: Military command and control")]

Theory X and Theory Y also have implications in military [command and
control](/wiki/Command\_and\_control "Command and control") (C2). Older,
strictly hierarchical conceptions of C2, with narrow centralization of
decision rights, highly constrained patterns of interaction, and limited
information distribution tend to arise from cultural and organizational
assumptions compatible with Theory X. On the other hand, more modern, network-
centric, and decentralized concepts of C2, that rely on individual initiative
and self-synchronization, tend to arise more from a "Theory Y" philosophy.[13]
[Mission Command](/wiki/Mission\_Command "Mission Command"), for example, is a
command philosophy to which many modern military establishments aspire, and
which involves individual judgment and action within the overall framework of
the commander's intent. Its assumptions about the value of individual
initiative make it more a Theory-Y than a Theory X philosophy.[14]
