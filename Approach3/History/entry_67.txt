%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%GROUND_TRUTH%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Ground Truth : 

C.V. Ananda Bose is an Indian civil servant who served in the Indian Administrative Service.
He is notable for not yielding to the corrupt system of the Indian bureaucracy.
An eminent administrator, writer, orator, and innovator, Dr. C.V. Ananda Bose pioneered pathbreaking administrative innovations in rural development, affordable housing, eco-tourism development, redressal of public grievances, women's empowerment, development of weaker sections of society, and promotion of art and culture.
The innovations have found expression in various developmental programmes that have been executed at the district, state, and national levels in India.
It was in the area of low-cost housing that Dr. Bose pioneered a movement that won international acclaim.
He set up the first Nirmithi Kendra (building centre) in the country in the Kollam district, which became the institutional mechanism for the propagation of cost-effective, environment-friendly (CEEF) building technology.
This was positively evaluated by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, Government of India (1993).
Based on the Kollam model, the Government of India launched the National Building Centre Movement to replicate Nirmithi Kendras (building centres) in every district of the country.
The Nirmithi Movement was adjudged by the United Nations as one of the global best practices in the field of sustainable human settlement development.
Early in his career, Dr. Bose introduced the "Gramotsava" programme in Kerala, wherein the local people were encouraged to actively participate in the village development planning.
The initiative, launched in the Kasargode district of Kerala in the 1980s, was subsequently implemented in 200 panchayats across the state.
Dr. Bose also founded the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) in the Kollam district during his tenure as Collector.
The Council generated high tourism interest in the region and created new job opportunities for the local people.
The Government of Kerala subsequently set up similar councils in all 14 districts of the state.
DTPs have made perceptible contributions in positioning Kerala as "God's own country".
He later pioneered an eco-village programme in the Mannanan village of the Kottayam district of Kerala, wherein the family clusters were encouraged to pursue activities such as organic farming, soil and water conservation through traditional methods, floriculture, horticulture, vermiculture, generation of energy from non-conventional sources, homestead forestry, etc., with institutional support, governmental assistance, and financial support from different agencies.
As Chairman of the Atomic Energy Education Society, Mumbai, Dr. Bose introduced and reinforced the concept of alternative education, wherein people could pursue studies in disciplines in which they did not have prior academic backgrounds.
He founded the Institute of Alternative Education.
He also launched the ASTER Project (Application of Science Technology in Educational Reforms) which sought to alter the mode of academic delivery through the application of information and communication technology (ICT).
As Managing Director of NAFED, Dr. Bose initiated a few innovative programmes which helped control the price spiral during 2009-10.
Christened as "Farm Gate to Home Gate", this innovation sought to buy agricultural produce directly from the farmers for distribution among the consumers, taking only marginal profit.
Spurred by the success of this pilot programme in New Delhi, the Easy Market Scheme was envisaged for price control in the rest of the country.
As the administrator of the National Museum, Dr. Bose launched a 100-day programme which spelt out specific measures to revamp and revitalise the institution.
Most of the improvements suggested were achieved in 60 days, such as opening the closed-down galleries, modernising the display and lighting, launching outreach programmes to take the museum to the community, arranging children's programmes to ignite young minds to the greatness of India's national heritage, organising international exhibitions, and launching the People's Museum Movement, to mention a few.
Pursuit of excellence was always central to Dr. Bose's role in public administration.
His contributions were seldom circumscribed by the call of duty.
Instead, he has been engaged in continuous research and field experimentation in developing the most appropriate, people-first solutions.
He also took key steps to synergise the various government programmes and schemes to create comprehensive, sustainable, and inclusive administrative mechanisms that have since been replicated in multiple domains.
In recognition of this remarkable turnaround of the museum management and the perceptible makeover of the institution, the Government of India asked Dr. Bose to continue with this mission even after his retirement from service.
