"Edit section: Scientific Revolution")]

During the 16th and 17th centuries, a large advancement of scientific progress
known as the [Scientific Revolution](/wiki/Scientific\_Revolution "Scientific
Revolution") took place in Europe. Dissatisfaction with older philosophical
approaches had begun earlier and had produced other changes in society, such
as the [Protestant Reformation](/wiki/Protestant\_Reformation "Protestant
Reformation"), but the revolution in science began when [natural
philosophers](/wiki/Natural\_philosophy "Natural philosophy") began to mount a
sustained attack on the [Scholastic](/wiki/Scholasticism "Scholasticism")
philosophical programme and supposed that mathematical descriptive schemes
adopted from such fields as mechanics and astronomy could actually yield
universally valid characterizations of motion and other concepts.
