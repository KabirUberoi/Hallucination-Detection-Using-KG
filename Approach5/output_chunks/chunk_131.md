The normal (or strategic form) game is usually represented by a
[matrix](/wiki/Matrix\_\(mathematics\) "Matrix \(mathematics\)") which shows
the players, strategies, and payoffs (see the example to the right). More
generally it can be represented by any function that associates a payoff for
each player with every possible combination of actions. In the accompanying
example there are two players; one chooses the row and the other chooses the
column. Each player has two strategies, which are specified by the number of
rows and the number of columns. The payoffs are provided in the interior. The
first number is the payoff received by the row player (Player 1 in our
example); the second is the payoff for the column player (Player 2 in our
example). Suppose that Player 1 plays \_Up\_ and that Player 2 plays \_Left\_.
Then Player 1 gets a payoff of 4, and Player 2 gets 3.

When a game is presented in normal form, it is presumed that each player acts
simultaneously or, at least, without knowing the actions of the other. If
players have some information about the choices of other players, the game is
usually presented in extensive form.

Every extensive-form game has an equivalent normal-form game, however, the
transformation to normal form may result in an exponential blowup in the size
of the representation, making it computationally impractical.[51]
