"Edit section: Prevention of disease and pregnancy")]

Preventing the spread of [HIV](/wiki/HIV "HIV") and [teenage
pregnancy](/wiki/Teenage\_pregnancy "Teenage pregnancy") are examples of
reasons given by proponents of virginity testing. In 2004, a
[Zimbabwean](/wiki/Zimbabwe "Zimbabwe") village chief, [Naboth
Makoni](/w/index.php?title=Naboth\_Makoni&action=edit&redlink=1 "Naboth Makoni

virginity tests as a way of protecting his people against HIV. He explained
that he focuses on girls because he believes they are easier to control than
boys.[55] In [South Africa](/wiki/South\_Africa "South Africa"), where
virginity testing is banned for girls under the age of 16, the
[Zulu](/wiki/Zulu\_people "Zulu people") tribe believes that the practice
prevents the spread of HIV and teenage pregnancy.[11] A woman interviewed by
the \_[Washington Post](/wiki/Washington\_Post "Washington Post")\_ stated that
"[Virginity testing] is important so that young girls become scared of boys.
Because what happens is first the boy strips you of your virginity, and the
next thing you know is you are pregnant and you have HIV."[11]
