In the afterword to the third edition (published in 1982, pp 360-368 of the
1991 edition) Capra offers six suggestions for a new paradigm in science.

 \* Consider the part and the whole as more symmetrically conditioning one another.
 \* Replace thinking in terms of structure with thinking in terms of process.
 \* Replace ‘objective science’ with ‘epistemic science’, where the approach to decide what counts as knowledge adapts to the subject studied.
 \* Replace the idea of knowledge as buildings based on foundations with an idea of knowledge as networks.
 \* Abandon the quest for truth with a quest for better approximations.
 \* Abandon the ideas of domination of nature with one of cooperation and nonviolence.

Capra reconnects this new paradigm to the theories of living and self-
organizing systems that has emerged from [cybernetics](/wiki/Cybernetics
"Cybernetics"). Here he quotes [Ilya Prigogine](/wiki/Ilya\_Prigogine "Ilya
Prigogine"), [Gregory Bateson](/wiki/Gregory\_Bateson "Gregory Bateson"),
[Humberto Maturana](/wiki/Humberto\_Maturana "Humberto Maturana") and
[Francisco Varela](/wiki/Francisco\_Varela "Francisco Varela") (p.372 of the
1991 edition).
