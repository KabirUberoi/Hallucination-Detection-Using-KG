### Influence of critical
theory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Conspiracy\_theory&action=edit&section=27
"Edit section: Influence of critical theory")]

[Bruno Latour](/wiki/Bruno\_Latour "Bruno Latour") notes that the language and
intellectual tactics of [critical theory](/wiki/Critical\_theory "Critical
theory") have been appropriated by those he describes as conspiracy theorists,
including [climate-change denialists](/wiki/Climate\_change\_denial "Climate
change denial") and the [9/11 Truth movement](/wiki/9/11\_Truth\_movement "9/11
Truth movement"): "Maybe I am taking conspiracy theories too seriously, but I
am worried to detect, in those mad mixtures of knee-jerk disbelief,
punctilious demands for proofs, and free use of powerful explanation from the
social neverland, many of the weapons of social critique."[143]
