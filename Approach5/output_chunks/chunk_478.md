#### Kepler's
supernova[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galileo\_Galilei&action=edit&section=6
"Edit section: Kepler's supernova")]

[Tycho Brahe](/wiki/Tycho\_Brahe "Tycho Brahe") and others had observed the
[supernova of 1572](/wiki/Supernova\_of\_1572 "Supernova of 1572"). Ottavio
Brenzoni's letter of 15 January 1605 to Galileo brought the 1572 supernova and
the less bright nova of 1601 to Galileo's notice. Galileo observed and
discussed [Kepler's Supernova](/wiki/Kepler%27s\_Supernova "Kepler's
Supernova") in 1604. Since these new stars displayed no detectable [diurnal
parallax](/wiki/Parallax#Diurnal\_parallax "Parallax"), Galileo concluded that
they were distant stars, and, therefore, disproved the Aristotelian belief in
the immutability of the heavens.[41]
