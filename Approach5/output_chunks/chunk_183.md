section: Walker's five kinds")]

[Jesse Walker](/wiki/Jesse\_Walker "Jesse Walker") (2013) has identified five
kinds of conspiracy theories:[76]

 \* The "Enemy Outside" refers to theories based on figures alleged to be scheming against a community from without.
 \* The "Enemy Within" finds the conspirators lurking inside the nation, indistinguishable from ordinary citizens.
 \* The "Enemy Above" involves powerful people manipulating events for their own gain.
 \* The "Enemy Below" features the lower classes working to overturn the social order.
 \* The "Benevolent Conspiracies" are angelic forces that work behind the scenes to improve the world and help people.
