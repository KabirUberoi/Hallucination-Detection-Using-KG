Elements of what became physics were drawn primarily from the fields of
[astronomy](/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), [optics](/wiki/Optics "Optics"), and
[mechanics](/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics"), which were methodologically united
through the study of [geometry](/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"). These mathematical
disciplines began in [antiquity](/wiki/Ancient\_history "Ancient history") with
the [Babylonians](/wiki/Babylonia "Babylonia") and with
[Hellenistic](/wiki/Hellenistic\_civilization "Hellenistic civilization")
writers such as [Archimedes](/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes") and
[Ptolemy](/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy"). [Ancient
philosophy](/wiki/Ancient\_philosophy "Ancient philosophy"), meanwhile,
included what was called "[Physics](/wiki/Physics "Physics")".
