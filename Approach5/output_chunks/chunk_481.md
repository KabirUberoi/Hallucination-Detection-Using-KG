#### Jupiter's
moons[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galileo\_Galilei&action=edit&section=9 "Edit
section: Jupiter's moons")]

On 7 January 1610, Galileo observed with his telescope what he described at
the time as "three fixed stars, totally invisible[a] by their smallness", all
close to Jupiter, and lying on a straight line through it.[49] Observations on
subsequent nights showed that the positions of these "stars" relative to
Jupiter were changing in a way that would have been inexplicable if they had
really been [fixed stars](/wiki/Fixed\_stars "Fixed stars"). On 10 January,
Galileo noted that one of them had disappeared, an observation which he
attributed to its being hidden behind Jupiter. Within a few days, he concluded
that they were [orbiting](/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") Jupiter: he had discovered
[three of Jupiter's four largest moons](/wiki/Moons\_of\_Jupiter "Moons of
Jupiter").[50] He discovered the fourth on 13 January. Galileo named the group
of four the \_Medicean stars\_ , in honour of his future patron, [Cosimo II de'
Medici, Grand Duke of
Tuscany](/wiki/Cosimo\_II\_de%27\_Medici,\_Grand\_Duke\_of\_Tuscany "Cosimo II de'
Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany"), and Cosimo's three brothers.[51] Later
astronomers, however, renamed them \_[Galilean satellites](/wiki/Galilean\_moons
"Galilean moons")\_ in honour of their discoverer. These satellites were
independently discovered by [Simon Marius](/wiki/Simon\_Marius "Simon Marius")
on 8 January 1610 and are now called [Io](/wiki/Io\_\(moon\) "Io \(moon\)"),
[Europa](/wiki/Europa\_\(moon\) "Europa \(moon\)"),
[Ganymede](/wiki/Ganymede\_\(moon\) "Ganymede \(moon\)"), and
[Callisto](/wiki/Callisto\_\(moon\) "Callisto \(moon\)"), the names given by
Marius in his \_Mundus Iovialis\_ published in 1614.[52]

Galileo's observations of the satellites of Jupiter caused controversy in
astronomy: a planet with smaller planets orbiting it did not conform to the
principles of [Aristotelian cosmology](/wiki/On\_the\_Heavens "On the Heavens"),
which held that all heavenly bodies should circle the Earth,[53][54] and many
astronomers and philosophers initially refused to believe that Galileo could
have discovered such a thing.[55][56] Compounding this problem, other
astronomers had difficulty confirming Galileo's observations. When he
demonstrated the telescope in Bologna, the attendees struggled to see the
moons. One of them, Martin Horky, noted that some fixed stars, such as [Spica
Virginis](/wiki/Spica "Spica"), appeared double through the telescope. He took
this as evidence that the instrument was deceptive when viewing the heavens,
casting doubt on the existence of the moons.[57][58] [Christopher
Clavius](/wiki/Christopher\_Clavius "Christopher Clavius")'s observatory in
Rome confirmed the observations and, although unsure how to interpret them,
gave Galileo a hero's welcome when he visited the next year.[59] Galileo
continued to observe the satellites over the next eighteen months, and by
mid-1611, he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods—a
feat which [Johannes Kepler](/wiki/Johannes\_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") had
believed impossible.[60][61]

Galileo saw a practical use for his discovery. Determining the east–west
position of ships at sea required their clocks be synchronized with clocks at
the [prime meridian](/wiki/Prime\_meridian "Prime meridian"). Solving this
[longitude problem](/wiki/Longitude\_problem "Longitude problem") had great
importance to safe navigation and large prizes were established by Spain and
later Holland for its solution. Since eclipses of the moons he discovered were
relatively frequent and their times could be predicted with great accuracy,
they could be used to set shipboard clocks and Galileo applied for the prizes.
Observing the moons from a ship proved too difficult, but the method was used
for land surveys, including the remapping of France.[62]: 15–16 [63]
