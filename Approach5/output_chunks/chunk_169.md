Relativity is a [falsifiable](/wiki/Falsifiability "Falsifiability") theory:
It makes predictions that can be tested by experiment. In the case of special
relativity, these include the principle of relativity, the constancy of the
speed of light, and time dilation.[12] The predictions of special relativity
have been confirmed in numerous tests since Einstein published his paper in
1905, but three experiments conducted between 1881 and 1938 were critical to
its validation. These are the [Michelson–Morley
experiment](/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley\_experiment "Michelson–Morley
experiment"), the [Kennedy–Thorndike
experiment](/wiki/Kennedy%E2%80%93Thorndike\_experiment "Kennedy–Thorndike
experiment"), and the [Ives–Stilwell
experiment](/wiki/Ives%E2%80%93Stilwell\_experiment "Ives–Stilwell
experiment"). Einstein derived the [Lorentz
transformations](/wiki/Lorentz\_transformation "Lorentz transformation") from
first principles in 1905, but these three experiments allow the
transformations to be induced from experimental evidence.

[Maxwell's equations](/wiki/Maxwell%27s\_equations "Maxwell's equations")—the
foundation of classical electromagnetism—describe light as a wave that moves
with a characteristic velocity. The modern view is that light needs no medium
of transmission, but Maxwell and his contemporaries were convinced that light
waves were propagated in a medium, analogous to sound propagating in air, and
ripples propagating on the surface of a pond. This hypothetical medium was
called the [luminiferous aether](/wiki/Luminiferous\_aether "Luminiferous
aether"), at rest relative to the "fixed stars" and through which the Earth
moves. Fresnel's [partial ether dragging
hypothesis](/wiki/Aether\_drag\_hypothesis#Partial\_aether\_dragging "Aether drag
hypothesis") ruled out the measurement of first-order (v/c) effects, and
although observations of second-order effects (v2/c2) were possible in
principle, Maxwell thought they were too small to be detected with then-
current technology.[13][14]

The Michelson–Morley experiment was designed to detect second-order effects of
the "aether wind"—the motion of the aether relative to the Earth. Michelson
designed an instrument called the [Michelson
interferometer](/wiki/Michelson\_interferometer "Michelson interferometer") to
accomplish this. The apparatus was sufficiently accurate to detect the
expected effects, but he obtained a null result when the first experiment was
conducted in 1881,[15] and again in 1887.[16] Although the failure to detect
an aether wind was a disappointment, the results were accepted by the
scientific community.[14] In an attempt to salvage the aether paradigm,
FitzGerald and Lorentz independently created an [\_ad hoc\_
hypothesis](/wiki/Ad\_hoc\_hypothesis "Ad hoc hypothesis") in which the length
of material bodies changes according to their motion through the aether.[17]
This was the origin of [FitzGerald–Lorentz
contraction](/wiki/FitzGerald%E2%80%93Lorentz\_contraction "FitzGerald–Lorentz
contraction"), and their hypothesis had no theoretical basis. The
interpretation of the null result of the Michelson–Morley experiment is that
the round-trip travel time for light is [isotropic](/wiki/Isotropic
"Isotropic") (independent of direction), but the result alone is not enough to
discount the theory of the aether or validate the predictions of special
relativity.[18][19]

While the Michelson–Morley experiment showed that the velocity of light is
isotropic, it said nothing about how the magnitude of the velocity changed (if
at all) in different [inertial frames](/wiki/Inertial\_frame "Inertial frame").
The Kennedy–Thorndike experiment was designed to do that, and was first
performed in 1932 by Roy Kennedy and Edward Thorndike.[20] They obtained a
null result, and concluded that "there is no effect ... unless the velocity of
the solar system in space is no more than about half that of the earth in its
orbit".[19][21] That possibility was thought to be too coincidental to provide
an acceptable explanation, so from the null result of their experiment it was
concluded that the round-trip time for light is the same in all inertial
reference frames.[18][19]

The Ives–Stilwell experiment was carried out by Herbert Ives and G.R. Stilwell
first in 1938[22] and with better accuracy in 1941.[23] It was designed to
test the [transverse Doppler effect](/wiki/Transverse\_Doppler\_effect
"Transverse Doppler effect") - the [redshift](/wiki/Redshift "Redshift") of
light from a moving source in a direction perpendicular to its velocity—which
had been predicted by Einstein in 1905. The strategy was to compare observed
Doppler shifts with what was predicted by classical theory, and look for a
[Lorentz factor](/wiki/Lorentz\_factor "Lorentz factor") correction. Such a
correction was observed, from which was concluded that the frequency of a
moving atomic clock is altered according to special relativity.[18][19]

Those classic experiments have been repeated many times with increased
precision. Other experiments include, for instance, [relativistic energy and
momentum increase](/wiki/Tests\_of\_relativistic\_energy\_and\_momentum "Tests of
relativistic energy and momentum") at high velocities, [experimental testing
of time dilation](/wiki/Experimental\_testing\_of\_time\_dilation "Experimental
testing of time dilation"), and [modern searches for Lorentz
violations](/wiki/Modern\_searches\_for\_Lorentz\_violation "Modern searches for
Lorentz violation").
