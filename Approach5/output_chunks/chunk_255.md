There is no reliable evidence that [aliens](/wiki/Extraterrestrial\_life
"Extraterrestrial life") have visited [Earth](/wiki/Earth "Earth"); we have
observed no [intelligent](/wiki/Intelligent "Intelligent") [extraterrestrial
life](/wiki/Extraterrestrial\_life "Extraterrestrial life") with current
technology, nor has [SETI](/wiki/SETI "SETI") found any transmissions from
other [civilizations](/wiki/Civilizations "Civilizations"). The
[Universe](/wiki/Universe "Universe"), apart from the Earth, seems "dead";
Hanson states:[1]

Life is expected to expand to fill all available niches.[5] With technology
such as [self-replicating spacecraft](/wiki/Self-replicating\_spacecraft "Self-
replicating spacecraft"), these niches would include neighboring star systems
and even, on longer time scales which are still small compared to the age of
the universe, other galaxies. Hanson notes, "If such advanced life had
substantially colonized our planet, we would know it by now."[1]
