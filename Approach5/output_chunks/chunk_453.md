### Equivalence between
formulations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Quantum\_mechanics&action=edit&section=6
"Edit section: Equivalence between formulations")]

There are many mathematically equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics.
One of the oldest and most common is the "[transformation
theory](/wiki/Transformation\_theory\_\(quantum\_mechanics\) "Transformation
theory \(quantum mechanics\)")" proposed by [Paul Dirac](/wiki/Paul\_Dirac
"Paul Dirac"), which unifies and generalizes the two earliest formulations of
quantum mechanics – [matrix mechanics](/wiki/Matrix\_mechanics "Matrix
mechanics") (invented by [Werner Heisenberg](/wiki/Werner\_Heisenberg "Werner
Heisenberg")) and wave mechanics (invented by [Erwin
Schrödinger](/wiki/Erwin\_Schr%C3%B6dinger "Erwin Schrödinger")).[32] An
alternative formulation of quantum mechanics is [Feynman](/wiki/Feynman
"Feynman")'s [path integral formulation](/wiki/Path\_integral\_formulation "Path
integral formulation"), in which a quantum-mechanical amplitude is considered
as a sum over all possible classical and non-classical paths between the
initial and final states. This is the quantum-mechanical counterpart of the
[action principle](/wiki/Action\_principle "Action principle") in classical
mechanics.[33]
