[David Saltzberg](/wiki/David\_Saltzberg "David Saltzberg"), a professor of
[physics](/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [astronomy](/wiki/Astronomy
"Astronomy") at the [University of California, Los
Angeles](/wiki/University\_of\_California,\_Los\_Angeles "University of
California, Los Angeles"), checked scripts and provided dialogue, mathematics
equations, and diagrams used as props.[4] According to executive
producer/cocreator [Bill Prady](/wiki/Bill\_Prady "Bill Prady"), "We're working
on giving Sheldon an actual problem that he's going to be working on
throughout the [first] season so there's actual progress to the boards ... We
worked hard to get all the science right."[5] Saltzberg, who has a Ph.D. in
physics, served as the science consultant for the show for six seasons and
attended every taping.[50] He saw early versions of scripts that needed
scientific information added to them, and he also pointed out where the
writers, despite their knowledge of science, had made a mistake. He was
usually not needed during a taping unless a lot of science, and especially the
whiteboard, was involved.[51]

Saltzberg sometimes needed assistance on biology from [Mayim
Bialik](/wiki/Mayim\_Bialik "Mayim Bialik"), who has a Ph.D. in
neuroscience.[51]
