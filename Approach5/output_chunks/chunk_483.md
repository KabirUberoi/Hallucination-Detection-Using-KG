#### Saturn and
Neptune[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galileo\_Galilei&action=edit&section=11 "Edit
section: Saturn and Neptune")]

In 1610, Galileo also observed the planet [Saturn](/wiki/Saturn "Saturn"), and
at first mistook its rings for planets,[66] thinking it was a three-bodied
system. When he observed the planet later, Saturn's rings were directly
oriented to Earth, causing him to think that two of the bodies had
disappeared. The rings reappeared when he observed the planet in 1616, further
confusing him.[67]

Galileo observed the planet [Neptune](/wiki/Neptune "Neptune") in 1612. It
appears in his notebooks as one of many unremarkable dim stars. He did not
realise that it was a planet, but he did note its motion relative to the stars
before losing track of it.[68]
