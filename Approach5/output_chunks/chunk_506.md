Galileo also concluded that objects \_retain their velocity\_ in the absence of
any impediments to their motion,[216] thereby contradicting the generally
accepted Aristotelian hypothesis that a body could only remain in so-called
["violent", "unnatural", or "forced"
motion](/wiki/Aristotelian\_physics#Unnatural\_motion "Aristotelian physics") so
long as an agent of change (the "mover") continued to act on it.[217]
Philosophical ideas relating to [inertia](/wiki/Inertia "Inertia") had been
proposed by [John Philoponus](/wiki/John\_Philoponus "John Philoponus") and
[Jean Buridan](/wiki/Jean\_Buridan "Jean Buridan"). Galileo stated:[218][219]

> Imagine any particle projected along a horizontal plane without friction;
> then we know, from what has been more fully explained in the preceding
> pages, that this particle will move along this same plane with a motion
> which is uniform and perpetual, provided the plane has no limits.

But the surface of the earth would be an instance of such a plane if all its
unevenness could be removed.[220] This was incorporated into [Newton's laws of
motion](/wiki/Newton%27s\_laws\_of\_motion "Newton's laws of motion") (first
law), except for the direction of the motion: Newton's is straight, Galileo's
is circular (for example, the planets' motion around the Sun, which according
to him, and unlike Newton, takes place in absence of gravity). According to
[Dijksterhuis](/wiki/Eduard\_Jan\_Dijksterhuis "Eduard Jan Dijksterhuis")
Galileo's conception of inertia as a tendency to persevere in circular motion
is closely related to his Copernican conviction.[221]
