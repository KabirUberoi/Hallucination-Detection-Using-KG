Daniel Ménard is a Canadian citizen and former General in the Canadian Armed Forces.
Ménard had commanded the Canadian Forces in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010.
Two different allegations triggered his replacement and demotion he was court-martialed for what was described as the reckless discharge of a weapon while safely back on base, and he was also alleged to have engaged in a sexual relationship with a subordinate.
Ménard resigned from the Armed Forces and took a job with GardaWorld, a private security firm, which assigned him to direct its private security operations in Afghanistan.
News of his arrest by Afghan authorities became public on January 29, 2014, when he first appeared in an Afghan court.

Accounts differ as to the nature of his arrest some sources assert he was arrested on weapons charges, while other sources assert Afghan authorities arrested him because his firm did not have, or no longer had, official authorization to perform security operations in Afghanistan.
GardaWorld has claimed his arrest is all due to a simple misunderstanding.
