Atomic, [molecular](/wiki/Molecule "Molecule"), and optical physics (AMO) is
the study of matter—matter and light—matter interactions on the scale of
single atoms and molecules. The three areas are grouped together because of
their interrelationships, the similarity of methods used, and the commonality
of their relevant energy scales. All three areas include both classical, semi-
classical and [quantum](/wiki/Quantum\_mechanics "Quantum mechanics")
treatments; they can treat their subject from a microscopic view (in contrast
to a macroscopic view).

Atomic physics studies the [electron shells](/wiki/Electron\_shell "Electron
shell") of atoms. Current research focuses on activities in quantum control,
cooling and trapping of atoms and ions,[76][77][78] low-temperature collision
dynamics and the effects of electron correlation on structure and dynamics.
Atomic physics is influenced by the [nucleus](/wiki/Atomic\_nucleus "Atomic
nucleus") (see [hyperfine splitting](/wiki/Hyperfine\_splitting "Hyperfine
splitting")), but intra-nuclear phenomena such as
[fission](/wiki/Nuclear\_fission "Nuclear fission") and
[fusion](/wiki/Nuclear\_fusion "Nuclear fusion") are considered part of nuclear
physics.

[Molecular physics](/wiki/Molecular\_physics "Molecular physics") focuses on
multi-atomic structures and their internal and external interactions with
matter and light. [Optical physics](/wiki/Optical\_physics "Optical physics")
is distinct from optics in that it tends to focus not on the control of
classical light fields by macroscopic objects but on the fundamental
properties of [optical fields](/wiki/Optical\_field "Optical field") and their
interactions with matter in the microscopic realm.
