\*\*Judge Holden\*\* is a purported historical person who partnered with [John
Joel Glanton](/wiki/John\_Joel\_Glanton "John Joel Glanton") as a professional
[scalp-hunter](/wiki/Scalping "Scalping") in
[Mexico](/wiki/Second\_Federal\_Republic\_of\_Mexico "Second Federal Republic of
Mexico") and the [American Southwest](/wiki/Southwestern\_United\_States
"Southwestern United States") during the mid-19th century.[1] To date, the
only source for Holden's existence is [Samuel
Chamberlain](/wiki/Samuel\_Chamberlain "Samuel Chamberlain")'s \_My Confession:
Recollections of a Rogue\_ , an [autobiographical](/wiki/Autobiography
"Autobiography") account of Chamberlain's life as a soldier during the
[Mexican–American War](/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American\_War "Mexican–American
War"). Chamberlain described Holden as the most ruthless of the roving band of
mercenaries led by Glanton, with whom Chamberlain had traveled briefly after
the war: "[he] had a fleshy frame, [and] a dull tallow colored face destitute
of hair and all expression";[2] "a man of gigantic size"; "by far the best
educated man in northern Mexico"; "in short another [Admirable
Crichton](/wiki/James\_Crichton "James Crichton"), and with all an arrant
coward".

Chamberlain disliked Holden intensely: "I hated him at first sight, and he
knew it," Chamberlain wrote. "Yet nothing could be more gentle and kind than
his deportment towards me; he would often seek conversation with me."[3]

He was popularized as the main antagonist of [Cormac
McCarthy](/wiki/Cormac\_McCarthy "Cormac McCarthy")'s novel \_[Blood
Meridian](/wiki/Blood\_Meridian "Blood Meridian")\_ (1985), where he is
described as "a massive, hairless, [albino](/wiki/Albino "Albino") man who
excels in shooting, languages, horsemanship, dancing, music, drawing,
diplomacy, science and anything else he seems to put his mind to. Despite his
almost infinite knowledge, in which he can use to achieve anything he desires,
Holden favours a life of murder and hate... He is also the chief proponent and
philosopher of the Glanton gang’s lawless warfare."[4]
