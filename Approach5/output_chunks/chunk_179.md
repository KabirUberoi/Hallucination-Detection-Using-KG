"Edit section: Difference from conspiracy")]

A conspiracy theory is not simply a [conspiracy](/wiki/Conspiracy
"Conspiracy"), which refers to any covert plan involving two or more
people.[10] In contrast, the term "conspiracy theory" refers to \_hypothesized\_
conspiracies that have specific characteristics. For example, conspiracist
beliefs invariably oppose the mainstream consensus among those people who are
qualified to evaluate their accuracy, such as [scientists](/wiki/Scientist
"Scientist") or [historians](/wiki/Historians "Historians").[11] Conspiracy
theorists see themselves as having privileged access to socially persecuted
knowledge or a stigmatized mode of thought that separates them from the masses
who believe the official account.[10] [Michael Barkun](/wiki/Michael\_Barkun
"Michael Barkun") describes a conspiracy theory as a "template imposed upon
the world to give the appearance of order to events".[10]

Real conspiracies, even very simple ones, are difficult to conceal and
routinely experience unexpected problems.[62] In contrast, conspiracy theories
suggest that conspiracies are unrealistically successful and that groups of
conspirators, such as [bureaucracies](/wiki/Bureaucracy "Bureaucracy"), can
act with near-perfect competence and secrecy. The causes of events or
situations are simplified to exclude complex or interacting factors, as well
as the role of chance and unintended consequences. Nearly all observations are
explained as having been deliberately planned by the alleged conspirators.[62]

In conspiracy theories, the conspirators are usually claimed to be acting with
extreme malice.[62] As described by Robert Brotherton:

> The malevolent intent assumed by most conspiracy theories goes far beyond
> everyday plots borne out of self-interest, corruption, cruelty, and
> criminality. The postulated conspirators are not merely people with selfish
> agendas or differing values. Rather, conspiracy theories postulate a black-
> and-white world in which good is struggling against evil. The general public
> is cast as the victim of organised persecution, and the motives of the
> alleged conspirators often verge on pure maniacal evil. At the very least,
> the conspirators are said to have an almost inhuman disregard for the basic
> liberty and well-being of the general population. More grandiose conspiracy
> theories portray the conspirators as being Evil Incarnate: of having caused
> all the ills from which we suffer, committing abominable acts of unthinkable
> cruelty on a routine basis, and striving ultimately to subvert or destroy
> everything we hold dear.[62]
