[Physics education](/wiki/Physics\_education "Physics education") or physics
teaching refers to the [education](/wiki/Education "Education") methods
currently used to [teach](/wiki/Teaching "Teaching") physics. The occupation
is called physics educator or physics teacher. [Physics education
research](/wiki/Physics\_education\_research "Physics education research")
refers to an area of pedagogical research that seeks to improve those methods.
Historically, physics has been taught at the high school and college level
primarily by the lecture method together with laboratory exercises aimed at
verifying concepts taught in the lectures. These concepts are better
understood when lectures are accompanied with demonstration, hand-on
experiments, and questions that require students to ponder what will happen in
an experiment and why. Students who participate in [active
learning](/wiki/Active\_learning "Active learning") for example with hands-on
experiments learn through self-discovery. By trial and error they learn to
change their preconceptions about phenomena in physics and discover the
underlying concepts. Physics education is part of the broader area of [science
education](/wiki/Science\_education "Science education").
