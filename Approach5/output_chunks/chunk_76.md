Prior to 1995, theorists believed that there were five consistent versions of
superstring theory (type I, type IIA, type IIB, and two versions of heterotic
string theory). This understanding changed in 1995 when [Edward
Witten](/wiki/Edward\_Witten "Edward Witten") suggested that the five theories
were just special limiting cases of an eleven-dimensional theory called
M-theory. Witten's conjecture was based on the work of a number of other
physicists, including [Ashoke Sen](/wiki/Ashoke\_Sen "Ashoke Sen"), [Chris
Hull](/wiki/Chris\_Hull "Chris Hull"), [Paul Townsend](/wiki/Paul\_Townsend
"Paul Townsend"), and [Michael Duff](/wiki/Michael\_Duff\_\(physicist\) "Michael
Duff \(physicist\)"). His announcement led to a flurry of research activity
now known as the [second superstring
revolution](/wiki/Second\_superstring\_revolution "Second superstring
revolution").[31]
