lester halbert germer october 10 1896 october 3 1971 was an american physicist. along with clinton davisson he proved the waveparticle duality of matter in the davissongermer experiment which was important to the development of the electron microscope. these studies supported the theoretical work of de broglie. he also studied thermionics erosion of metals and contact physics. he was awarded the elliott cresson medal in 1931. a former fighter pilot in world war i germer subsequently worked at bell labs in new jersey. in 1945 at the age of 49 germer launched a side career as a rock climber. he climbed widely around the northeast united states and especially at new yorks shawangunk ridge. although the appalachian mountain club was dominant in the area at the time and strictly regulated rock climbing lester was never associated with the club and found himself in conflict with the leading climber in the area hans kraus who was head of the amcs safety committee. he was once turned down for climbing certification with the comment likes people too much and is too enthusiastic. lester was known for being generous and friendly. he was once called a one man climbing school. in 1971 one week before his 75th birthday lester germer died of a massive heart attack while lead climbing a rock climb at the shawangunk ridge eyebrow 5.6. until that moment lester had a twentysix year perfect safety record in rock climbing he had never even taken a leader fall.
