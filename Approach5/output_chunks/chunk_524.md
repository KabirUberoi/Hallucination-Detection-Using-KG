According to Capra, [Werner Heisenberg](/wiki/Werner\_Heisenberg "Werner
Heisenberg") was in agreement with the main idea of the book:[3]

> I showed the manuscript to him chapter by chapter, briefly summarizing the
> content of each chapter and emphasizing especially the topics related to his
> own work. Heisenberg was most interested in the entire manuscript and very
> open to hearing my ideas. I told him that I saw two basic themes running
> through all the theories of modern physics, which were also the two basic
> themes of all mystical traditions-the fundamental interrelatedness and
> interdependence of all phenomena and the intrinsically dynamic nature of
> reality. Heisenberg agreed with me as far as physics was concerned and he
> also told me that he was well aware of the emphasis on interconnectedness in
> Eastern thought. However, he had been unaware of the dynamic aspect of the
> Eastern world view and was intrigued when I showed him with numerous
> examples from my manuscript that the principal Sanskrit terms used in Hindu
> and Buddhist philosophy-\_brahman, rta, lila, karma, samsara,\_ etc.-had
> dynamic connotations. At the end of my rather long presentation of the
> manuscript Heisenberg said simply: "Basically, I am in complete agreement
> with you."

The book was a best-seller in the United States. It received a positive review
from [\_New York\_ magazine](/wiki/New\_York\_\(magazine\) "New York
\(magazine\)"):

> A brilliant best-seller.... Lucidly analyzes the tenets of Hinduism,
> Buddhism, and Taoism to show their striking parallels with the latest
> discoveries in cyclotrons.

Victor N. Mansfield, a professor of physics and astronomy at [Colgate
University](/wiki/Colgate\_University "Colgate University") who wrote many
papers and books of his own connecting physics to [Buddhism](/wiki/Buddhism
"Buddhism") and also to [Jungian psychology](/wiki/Analytical\_psychology
"Analytical psychology"),[4] complimented \_The Tao of Physics\_ in \_[Physics
Today](/wiki/Physics\_Today "Physics Today")\_ :[5][6]

However, it is not without its critics. [Jeremy
Bernstein](/wiki/Jeremy\_Bernstein "Jeremy Bernstein"), a professor of physics
at the [Stevens Institute of Technology](/wiki/Stevens\_Institute\_of\_Technology
"Stevens Institute of Technology"),[7] chastised \_The Tao of Physics\_ :[8]

> evidence of deeply rooted connections. Thus I agree with Capra when he

> and profoundly misleading book.

[Leon M. Lederman](/wiki/Leon\_M.\_Lederman "Leon M. Lederman"), a Nobel Prize-
winning physicist and current Director Emeritus of [Fermilab](/wiki/Fermilab
"Fermilab"), criticized both \_The Tao of Physics\_ and [Gary
Zukav](/wiki/Gary\_Zukav "Gary Zukav")'s \_[The Dancing Wu Li
Masters](/wiki/The\_Dancing\_Wu\_Li\_Masters "The Dancing Wu Li Masters")\_ in his
1993 book \_[The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the
Question?](/wiki/The\_God\_Particle:\_If\_the\_Universe\_Is\_the\_Answer,\_What\_Is\_the\_Question%3F
"The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question?")\_[9]

> Starting with reasonable descriptions of quantum physics, he constructs

> tears go into each painful advance.

Philosopher of science [Eric Scerri](/wiki/Eric\_Scerri "Eric Scerri")
criticizes both Capra and Zukav and similar books.[10]

[Peter Woit](/wiki/Peter\_Woit "Peter Woit"), a [mathematical
physicist](/wiki/Mathematical\_physics "Mathematical physics") at [Columbia
University](/wiki/Columbia\_University "Columbia University"), criticized Capra
for continuing to build his case for physics-mysticism parallels on the
[bootstrap model](/wiki/Bootstrap\_model "Bootstrap model") of [strong-
force](/wiki/Strong\_interaction "Strong interaction") interactions set out at
the end of the book,[6] long after the [Standard Model](/wiki/Standard\_Model
"Standard Model") had become thoroughly accepted by physicists as a better
model:[11]

> \_The Tao of Physics\_ was completed in December 1974, and the implications of
> the [November Revolution](/wiki/November\_Revolution\_\(physics\) "November
> Revolution \(physics\)") one month earlier that led to the dramatic

> very gratifying for me that none of these recent developments has
> invalidated anything I wrote seven years ago. In fact, most of them were
> anticipated in the original edition," a statement far from any relation to

In a 2019 commemoration in honour of physicist [Geoffrey
Chew](/wiki/Geoffrey\_Chew "Geoffrey Chew"), one of bootstrap's "fathers",
Capra replied to criticisms such as Woit's:

> However, the standard model does not include gravity, and hence fails to
> integrate all known particles and forces into a single mathematical
> framework. The currently most popular candidate for such a framework is
> [string theory](/wiki/String\_theory "String theory"), which pictures all
> particles as different vibrations of mathematical "strings" in an abstract
> 9-dimensional space. The mathematical elegance of string theory is
> compelling, but the theory has serious deficiencies. If these difficulties
> persist, and if a theory of "quantum gravity" continues to remain elusive,
> the bootstrap idea may well be revived someday, in some mathematical
> formulation or other.[12]
