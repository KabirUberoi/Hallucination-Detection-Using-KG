Hypothesis of barriers to forming interstellar civilizations

This article is about an implication of the Fermi paradox. For the music album
by Tub Ring, see [The Great Filter (album)](/wiki/The\_Great\_Filter\_\(album\)
"The Great Filter \(album\)").

The \*\*Great Filter\*\* is the idea that, in the development of life from the
earliest stages of [abiogenesis](/wiki/Abiogenesis "Abiogenesis") to reaching
the highest levels of development on the [Kardashev
scale](/wiki/Kardashev\_scale "Kardashev scale"), there is a barrier to
development that makes detectable extraterrestrial life exceedingly
rare.[1][2] The Great Filter is one possible resolution of the [Fermi
paradox](/wiki/Fermi\_paradox "Fermi paradox").

The concept originates in [Robin Hanson](/wiki/Robin\_Hanson "Robin Hanson")'s
argument that the failure to find any
[extraterrestrial](/wiki/Extraterrestrial\_life "Extraterrestrial life")
civilizations in the [observable universe](/wiki/Observable\_universe
"Observable universe") implies that something is wrong with one or more of the
arguments (from various scientific disciplines) that the appearance of
advanced intelligent life is probable; this observation is conceptualized in
terms of a "Great Filter" which acts to reduce the great number of sites where
intelligent life might arise to the tiny number of intelligent species with
advanced civilizations actually observed (currently just one:
[human](/wiki/Human "Human")).[3] This probability threshold, which could lie
in the past or following [human extinction](/wiki/Human\_extinction "Human
extinction"), might work as a barrier to the evolution of intelligent life, or
as a high probability of self-destruction.[1][4] The main conclusion of this
argument is that the easier it was for life to evolve to the present stage,
the bleaker the future chances of humanity probably are.

The idea was first proposed in an online essay titled "The Great Filter â€“ Are
We Almost Past It?", written by economist Robin Hanson. The first version was
written in August 1996 and the article was last updated on September 15,
1998[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great\_Filter&action=edit).
Hanson's formulation has received recognition in several published sources
discussing the Fermi paradox and its implications.
