In 1821, [William Hamilton](/wiki/William\_Rowan\_Hamilton "William Rowan
Hamilton") began his analysis of Hamilton's characteristic function. In 1835,
he stated [Hamilton's canonical equations of
motion](/wiki/Hamiltonian\_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics").

In 1813, [Peter Ewart](/wiki/Peter\_Ewart "Peter Ewart") supported the idea of
the conservation of energy in his paper \_On the measure of moving force\_. In
1829, [Gaspard Coriolis](/wiki/Gaspard-Gustave\_Coriolis "Gaspard-Gustave
Coriolis") introduced the terms of [work](/wiki/Work\_\(physics\) "Work
\(physics\)") (force times distance) and [kinetic energy](/wiki/Kinetic\_energy
"Kinetic energy") with the meanings they have today. In 1841, [Julius Robert
von Mayer](/wiki/Julius\_Robert\_von\_Mayer "Julius Robert von Mayer"), an
[amateur](/wiki/Amateur "Amateur") scientist, wrote a paper on the
conservation of energy, although his lack of academic training led to its
rejection. In 1847, [Hermann von Helmholtz](/wiki/Hermann\_von\_Helmholtz
"Hermann von Helmholtz") formally stated the law of conservation of energy.
