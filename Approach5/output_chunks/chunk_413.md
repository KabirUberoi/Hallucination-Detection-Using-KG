possible signature of a Higgs boson from a simulated [proton](/wiki/Proton
"Proton")–proton collision. It decays almost immediately into two jets of
[hadrons](/wiki/Hadron "Hadron") and two electrons, visible as lines.

On July 4, 2012, physicists working at CERN's [Large Hadron
Collider](/wiki/Large\_Hadron\_Collider "Large Hadron Collider") announced that
they had discovered a new subatomic particle greatly resembling the [Higgs
boson](/wiki/Higgs\_boson "Higgs boson"), a potential key to an understanding
of why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity
and life in the universe.[78] For now, some physicists are calling it a
"Higgslike" particle.[78] [Joe Incandela](/wiki/Joe\_Incandela "Joe
Incandela"), of the [University of California, Santa
Barbara](/wiki/University\_of\_California,\_Santa\_Barbara "University of
California, Santa Barbara"), said, "It's something that may, in the end, be
one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last
30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of [quarks](/wiki/Quark
"Quark"), for example."[78] [Michael
Turner](/wiki/Michael\_Turner\_\(cosmologist\) "Michael Turner
\(cosmologist\)"), a cosmologist at the University of Chicago and the chairman
of the physics center board, said:

[Peter Higgs](/wiki/Peter\_Higgs "Peter Higgs") was one of six physicists,
working in three independent groups, who, in 1964, invented the notion of the
Higgs field ("cosmic molasses"). The others were [Tom Kibble](/wiki/Tom\_Kibble
"Tom Kibble") of [Imperial College, London](/wiki/Imperial\_College\_London
"Imperial College London"); [Carl Hagen](/wiki/C.\_R.\_Hagen "C. R. Hagen") of
the [University of Rochester](/wiki/University\_of\_Rochester "University of
Rochester"); [Gerald Guralnik](/wiki/Gerald\_Guralnik "Gerald Guralnik") of
[Brown University](/wiki/Brown\_University "Brown University"); and [François
Englert](/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois\_Englert "François Englert") and [Robert
Brout](/wiki/Robert\_Brout "Robert Brout"), both of [Université libre de
Bruxelles](/wiki/Universit%C3%A9\_libre\_de\_Bruxelles "Université libre de
Bruxelles").[78]

Although they have never been seen, Higgslike fields play an important role in
theories of the universe and in string theory. Under certain conditions,
according to the strange accounting of Einsteinian physics, they can become
suffused with energy that exerts an antigravitational force. Such fields have
been proposed as the source of an enormous burst of expansion, known as
inflation, early in the universe and, possibly, as the secret of the dark
energy that now seems to be speeding up the expansion of the universe.[78]
