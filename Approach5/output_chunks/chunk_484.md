#### Sunspots[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galileo\_Galilei&action=edit&section=12
"Edit section: Sunspots")]

Galileo made naked-eye and telescopic studies of [sunspots](/wiki/Sunspot
"Sunspot").[69] Their existence raised another difficulty with the unchanging
perfection of the heavens as posited in orthodox Aristotelian celestial
physics. An apparent annual variation in their trajectories, observed by
[Francesco Sizzi](/wiki/Francesco\_Sizzi "Francesco Sizzi") and others in
1612â€“1613,[70] also provided a powerful argument against both the Ptolemaic
system and the geoheliocentric system of Tycho Brahe.[c] A dispute over
claimed priority in the discovery of sunspots, and in their interpretation,
led Galileo to a long and bitter feud with the [Jesuit](/wiki/Jesuit "Jesuit")
[Christoph Scheiner](/wiki/Christoph\_Scheiner "Christoph Scheiner"). In the
middle was [Mark Welser](/wiki/Mark\_Welser "Mark Welser"), to whom Scheiner
had announced his discovery, and who asked Galileo for his opinion. Both of
them were unaware of [Johannes Fabricius](/wiki/Johannes\_Fabricius "Johannes
Fabricius")' earlier observation and publication of sunspots.[74]
