 1. \*\*^\*\* A momentum eigenstate would be a perfectly monochromatic wave of infinite extent, which is not square-integrable. Likewise, a position eigenstate would be a [Dirac delta distribution](/wiki/Dirac\_delta\_function "Dirac delta function"), not square-integrable and technically not a function at all. Consequently, neither can belong to the particle's Hilbert space. Physicists sometimes introduce fictitious "bases" for a Hilbert space comprising elements outside that space. These are invented for calculational convenience and do not represent physical states.[25]: 100–105
 2. \*\*^\*\* See, for example, [the Feynman Lectures on Physics](/wiki/The\_Feynman\_Lectures\_on\_Physics "The Feynman Lectures on Physics") for some of the technological applications which use quantum mechanics, e.g., [transistors](/wiki/Transistor "Transistor") (vol \*\*III\*\* , pp. 14–11 ff), [integrated circuits](/wiki/Integrated\_circuit "Integrated circuit"), which are follow-on technology in solid-state physics (vol \*\*II\*\* , pp. 8–6), and [lasers](/wiki/Laser "Laser") (vol \*\*III\*\* , pp. 9–13).
 3. \*\*^\*\* see [macroscopic quantum phenomena](/wiki/Macroscopic\_quantum\_phenomena "Macroscopic quantum phenomena"), [Bose–Einstein condensate](/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein\_condensate "Bose–Einstein condensate"), and [Quantum machine](/wiki/Quantum\_machine "Quantum machine")
 4. \*\*^\*\* The published form of the EPR argument was due to Podolsky, and Einstein himself was not satisfied with it. In his own publications and correspondence, Einstein used a different argument to insist that quantum mechanics is an incomplete theory.[60][61][62][63]
