involves modeling the natural world with theory, usually quantitative. Here,
the path of a particle is modeled with the mathematics of
[calculus](/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") to explain its behavior: the purview of
the branch of physics known as [mechanics](/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics").

Physics covers a wide range of [phenomena](/wiki/Phenomenon "Phenomenon"),
from [elementary particles](/wiki/Elementary\_particle "Elementary particle")
(such as [quarks](/wiki/Quark "Quark"), [neutrinos](/wiki/Neutrino
"Neutrino"), and [electrons](/wiki/Electron "Electron")) to the largest
[superclusters](/wiki/Supercluster "Supercluster") of galaxies. Included in
these phenomena are the most basic objects composing all other things.
Therefore, physics is sometimes called the "fundamental science".[59] Physics
aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of
simpler phenomena. Thus, physics aims to both connect the things observable to
humans to root causes, and then connect these causes together.

For example, the [ancient Chinese](/wiki/History\_of\_China "History of China")
observed that certain rocks ([lodestone](/wiki/Lodestone "Lodestone") and
[magnetite](/wiki/Magnetite "Magnetite")) were attracted to one another by an
invisible force. This effect was later called magnetism, which was first
rigorously studied in the 17th century. But even before the Chinese discovered
magnetism, the [ancient Greeks](/wiki/Ancient\_Greece "Ancient Greece") knew of
other objects such as [amber](/wiki/Amber "Amber"), that when rubbed with fur
would cause a similar invisible attraction between the two.[65] This was also
first studied rigorously in the 17th century and came to be called
electricity. Thus, physics had come to understand two observations of nature
in terms of some root cause (electricity and magnetism). However, further work
in the 19th century revealed that these two forces were just two different
aspects of one forceâ€”[electromagnetism](/wiki/Electromagnetism
"Electromagnetism"). This process of "unifying" forces continues today, and
electromagnetism and the [weak nuclear force](/wiki/Weak\_nuclear\_force "Weak
nuclear force") are now considered to be two aspects of the [electroweak
interaction](/wiki/Electroweak\_interaction "Electroweak interaction"). Physics
hopes to find an ultimate reason (theory of everything) for why nature is as
it is (see section \_Current research\_ below for more information).[66]
