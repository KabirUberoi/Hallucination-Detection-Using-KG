### Rothbard: shallow vs.
deep[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Conspiracy\_theory&action=edit&section=9 "Edit
section: Rothbard: shallow vs. deep")]

[Murray Rothbard](/wiki/Murray\_Rothbard "Murray Rothbard") argues in favor of
a model that contrasts "deep" conspiracy theories to "shallow" ones. According
to Rothbard, a "shallow" theorist observes an event and asks \_[Cui
bono](/wiki/Cui\_bono "Cui bono")?\_ ("Who benefits?"), jumping to the
conclusion that a posited beneficiary is responsible for covertly influencing
events. On the other hand, the "deep" conspiracy theorist begins with a hunch
and then seeks out evidence. Rothbard describes this latter activity as a
matter of confirming with certain facts one's initial paranoia.[78]
