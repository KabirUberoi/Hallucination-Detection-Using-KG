"\*\*In Theory\*\* " is the 25th episode of the [fourth
season](/wiki/Star\_Trek:\_The\_Next\_Generation\_season\_4 "Star Trek: The Next
Generation season 4") of the American [science fiction](/wiki/Science\_fiction
"Science fiction") television series \_[Star Trek: The Next
Generation](/wiki/Star\_Trek:\_The\_Next\_Generation "Star Trek: The Next
Generation")\_ , originally aired on June 3, 1991, in [broadcast
syndication](/wiki/Broadcast\_syndication "Broadcast syndication"). The episode
was written by [Joe Menosky](/wiki/Joe\_Menosky "Joe Menosky") and [Ronald D.
Moore](/wiki/Ronald\_D.\_Moore "Ronald D. Moore") and was the directorial debut
of cast member [Patrick Stewart](/wiki/Patrick\_Stewart "Patrick Stewart").

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the
[Starfleet](/wiki/Starfleet "Starfleet") crew of the [Federation starship
Enterprise-D](/wiki/USS\_Enterprise\_\(NCC-1701-D\) "USS Enterprise
\(NCC-1701-D\)"). In this episode, [Data](/wiki/Data\_\(Star\_Trek\) "Data
\(Star Trek\)") ([Brent Spiner](/wiki/Brent\_Spiner "Brent Spiner")) accepts
the affections of shipmate Jenna D'Sora ([Michele
Scarabelli](/wiki/Michele\_Scarabelli "Michele Scarabelli")) and pursues a
romantic relationship with her. However, Jenna soon comprehends the downside
of a "programmed" relationship. As the couple attempts to work out their
problems, the \_Enterprise\_ moves into an area of space rendered deadly by a
[nebula](/wiki/Nebula "Nebula") that is tearing small gaps in the fabric of
space, deforming any matter that comes into contact with them.

"In Theory" received [Nielsen ratings](/wiki/Nielsen\_rating "Nielsen rating")
of 9.8 percent, making it the second least viewed episode of the fourth season
on first broadcast. Reviewers were ambivalent about the episode. They
criticized elements of the plot, such as the choice of Captain [Jean-Luc
Picard](/wiki/Jean-Luc\_Picard "Jean-Luc Picard") to pilot a shuttle in a
subplot instead of an experienced shuttle pilot, and felt that Data's romance
was ineffective. [Keith DeCandido](/wiki/Keith\_DeCandido "Keith DeCandido")
had the view that it was a re-hash of the [second
season](/wiki/Star\_Trek:\_The\_Next\_Generation\_season\_2 "Star Trek: The Next
Generation season 2") episode "[The
Dauphin](/wiki/The\_Dauphin\_\(Star\_Trek:\_The\_Next\_Generation\) "The Dauphin
\(Star Trek: The Next Generation\)")".
