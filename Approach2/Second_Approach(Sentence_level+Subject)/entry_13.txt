They played their first gig in early 1999 and fired the bass player a few months later, with Ben Thomas switching from guitar to bass.
By the summer of 2000, Perrier and Thomas' dissatisfaction with their drummer led to his departure, with Thomas switching from bass to drums so the band could continue as a two-piece.
