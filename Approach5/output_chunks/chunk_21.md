One form of philosophical theory is a \_metatheory\_ or \_meta-theory\_. A
metatheory is a theory whose subject matter is some other theory or set of
theories. In other words, it is a theory about theories.
[Statements](/wiki/Statement\_\(logic\) "Statement \(logic\)") made in the
metatheory about the theory are called [metatheorems](/wiki/Metatheorem
"Metatheorem").
