Far from being simply of theoretical interest, relativistic effects are
important practical engineering concerns. Satellite-based measurement needs to
take into account relativistic effects, as each satellite is in motion
relative to an Earth-bound user, and is thus in a different frame of reference
under the theory of relativity. Global positioning systems such as
[GPS](/wiki/GPS "GPS"), [GLONASS](/wiki/GLONASS "GLONASS"), and
[Galileo](/wiki/Galileo\_\(satellite\_navigation\) "Galileo \(satellite
navigation\)"), must account for all of the relativistic effects in order to
work with precision, such as the consequences of the Earth's gravitational
field.[24] This is also the case in the high-precision measurement of
time.[25] Instruments ranging from electron microscopes to particle
accelerators would not work if relativistic considerations were omitted.[26]
