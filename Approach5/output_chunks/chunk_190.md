### Target
audience[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Conspiracy\_theory&action=edit&section=14
"Edit section: Target audience")]

Strategies to address conspiracy theories have been divided into two
categories based on whether the target audience is the conspiracy theorists or
the general public.[50][48] These strategies have been described as reducing
[either the supply or the demand](/wiki/Supply\_and\_demand "Supply and demand")
for conspiracy theories.[48] Both approaches can be used at the same time,
although there may be issues of limited resources, or if arguments are used
which may appeal to one audience at the expense of the other.[48]
