A conspiracy theory may take any matter as its subject, but certain subjects
attract greater interest than others. Favored subjects include famous deaths
and assassinations, morally dubious government activities, suppressed
technologies, and "[false flag](/wiki/False\_flag "False flag")" terrorism.
Among the longest-standing and most widely recognized conspiracy theories are
notions concerning the [assassination of John F.
Kennedy](/wiki/John\_F.\_Kennedy\_assassination\_conspiracy\_theories "John F.
Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories"), the [1969 Apollo Moon
landings](/wiki/Moon\_landing\_conspiracy\_theories "Moon landing conspiracy
theories"), and the [9/11 terrorist attacks](/wiki/9/11\_conspiracy\_theories
"9/11 conspiracy theories"), as well as numerous theories pertaining to
alleged plots for world domination by various groups, both real and
imaginary.[63]
