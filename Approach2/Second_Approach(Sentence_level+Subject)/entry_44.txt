Ground Truth : 

Rudolfo Austria "Rudy" Fernandez, Sr. (July 26, 1927 - June 9, 1979) was a prominent Filipino labor leader, trade unionist, and staunch opponent of the late President Ferdinand Marcos in Davao City, Philippines.

He ran for the Interim Batasang Pambansa (IBP) in the Philippines in 1978 as an industrial labor sectoral representative for the Mindanao region but ultimately lost against his closest rival, Princess Porti Pacasum, daughter of one of the richest Lanao Muslim clans and owner of the biggest transport company in Lanao, Philippines.
