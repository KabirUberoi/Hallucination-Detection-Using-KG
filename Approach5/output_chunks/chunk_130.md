extensive form game

The extensive form can be used to formalize games with a time sequencing of
moves. Extensive form games can be visualised using game
[trees](/wiki/Tree\_\(graph\_theory\) "Tree \(graph theory\)") (as pictured
here). Here each [vertex](/wiki/Graph\_\(discrete\_mathematics\) "Graph
\(discrete mathematics\)") (or node) represents a point of choice for a
player. The player is specified by a number listed by the vertex. The lines
out of the vertex represent a possible action for that player. The payoffs are
specified at the bottom of the tree. The extensive form can be viewed as a
multi-player generalization of a [decision tree](/wiki/Decision\_tree "Decision
tree").[49] To solve any extensive form game, [backward
induction](/wiki/Backward\_induction "Backward induction") must be used. It
involves working backward up the game tree to determine what a rational player
would do at the last vertex of the tree, what the player with the previous
move would do given that the player with the last move is rational, and so on
until the first vertex of the tree is reached.[50]

The game pictured consists of two players. The way this particular game is
structured (i.e., with sequential decision making and perfect information),
\_Player 1\_ "moves" first by choosing either F or U (fair or unfair). Next in
the sequence, \_Player 2\_ , who has now observed \_Player 1\_ 's move, can choose
to play either A or R (accept or reject). Once \_Player 2\_ has made their
choice, the game is considered finished and each player gets their respective
payoff, represented in the image as two numbers, where the first number
represents Player 1's payoff, and the second number represents Player 2's
payoff. Suppose that \_Player 1\_ chooses U and then \_Player 2\_ chooses A:
\_Player 1\_ then gets a payoff of "eight" (which in real-world terms can be
interpreted in many ways, the simplest of which is in terms of money but could
mean things such as eight days of vacation or eight countries conquered or
even eight more opportunities to play the same game against other players) and
\_Player 2\_ gets a payoff of "two".

The extensive form can also capture simultaneous-move games and games with
imperfect information. To represent it, either a dotted line connects
different vertices to represent them as being part of the same information set
(i.e. the players do not know at which point they are), or a closed line is
drawn around them. (See example in the imperfect information section.)
