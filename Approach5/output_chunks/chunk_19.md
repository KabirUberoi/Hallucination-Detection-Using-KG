In mathematics the use of the term \_theory\_ is different, necessarily so,
since mathematics contains no explanations of natural phenomena, \_per se\_ ,
even though it may help provide insight into natural systems or be inspired by
them. In the general sense, a \_mathematical theory\_ is a branch of mathematics
devoted to some specific topics or methods, such as [set
theory](/wiki/Set\_theory "Set theory"), [number theory](/wiki/Number\_theory
"Number theory"), [group theory](/wiki/Group\_theory "Group theory"),
[probability theory](/wiki/Probability\_theory "Probability theory"), [game
theory](/wiki/Game\_theory "Game theory"), [control
theory](/wiki/Control\_theory "Control theory"), [perturbation
theory](/wiki/Perturbation\_theory "Perturbation theory"), etc., such as might
be appropriate for a single textbook.

In [mathematical logic](/wiki/Mathematical\_logic "Mathematical logic"), a
[theory](/wiki/Theory\_\(mathematical\_logic\) "Theory \(mathematical logic\)")
has a related but different sense: it is the collection of the theorems that
can be deduced from a given set of [axioms](/wiki/Axiom "Axiom"), given a
given set of [inference rules](/wiki/Inference\_rule "Inference rule").
