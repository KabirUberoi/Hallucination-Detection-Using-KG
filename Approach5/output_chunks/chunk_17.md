In [physics](/wiki/Physics "Physics") the term \_theory\_ is generally used for
a mathematical framework—derived from a small set of basic
[postulates](/wiki/Postulates "Postulates") (usually symmetries, like equality
of locations in space or in time, or identity of electrons, etc.)—which is
capable of producing experimental predictions for a given category of physical
systems. One good example is [classical
electromagnetism](/wiki/Classical\_electromagnetism "Classical
electromagnetism"), which encompasses results derived from [gauge
symmetry](/wiki/Gauge\_symmetry "Gauge symmetry") (sometimes called gauge
invariance) in a form of a few equations called [Maxwell's
equations](/wiki/Maxwell%27s\_equations "Maxwell's equations"). The specific
mathematical aspects of classical electromagnetic theory are termed "laws of
electromagnetism", reflecting the level of consistent and reproducible
evidence that supports them. Within electromagnetic theory generally, there
are numerous hypotheses about how electromagnetism applies to specific
situations. Many of these hypotheses are already considered adequately tested,
with new ones always in the making and perhaps untested.
