### Threats[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cassowary&action=edit&section=8 "Edit
section: Threats")]

In its main home of [New Guinea](/wiki/New\_Guinea "New Guinea"), cassowaries
are the island's largest and most dominant and formidable [bird](/wiki/Bird
"Bird"), as well as being one of the largest terrestrial endemic animals in
New Guinea. As such, adult cassowaries have no natural enemies other than
[humans](/wiki/Human "Human") (and even then, the birds are rarely hunted due
to their reputation, speed, wariness and self-defence, with juveniles being
preferred over adults for ceremonial purposes - on average, it is considered
very fortunate for a human hunter to kill one in every five years[42]), but
their chicks are vulnerable to large [pythons](/wiki/Pythonidae "Pythonidae"),
[monitor lizards](/wiki/Monitor\_lizard "Monitor lizard"), [New Guinea singing
dogs](/wiki/New\_Guinea\_singing\_dog "New Guinea singing dog"), and [Papuan
eagles](/wiki/Papuan\_eagle "Papuan eagle"). When threaten, it is known that
cassowary chicks emit different vocalisation calls to indicate the specific
threat, such as a hawk for example, before running underneath their
father.[45] Adult males aggressively defend their chicks. While adult males
usually scare off or kill most predators, a chick will occasionally be
separated in the chaos and become a potential target.[58]

However, in the relic populations of north-eastern [Australia](/wiki/Australia
"Australia"), the cassowary population faces threats from
[vehicles](/wiki/Vehicle "Vehicle"), and are in danger of being outcompeted by
[wild boars](/wiki/Wild\_boar "Wild boar"), with their eggs being most
vulnerable to boar predation.[59] Their chicks also face dangers and predation
from [domesticated dogs](/wiki/Domesticated\_dog "Domesticated dog"), which
results in a widespread decline in the Australian mainland. Because of such
frequent inter-species conflicts, hunting dogs are one of the biggest enemies
for cassowaries, and it is not unheard of for hunting dogs to accidentally
kill cassowary chicks instead of feral pigs, with the dogs in-turn, being
killed by the nearby adult rooster.[60] It is unknown why the cassowary
population in Australia is in decline, as the New Guinea population has dealt
with introduced [wild boars](/wiki/Wild\_boars "Wild boars"), [dogs](/wiki/Dogs
"Dogs") and [feral cats](/wiki/Feral\_cats "Feral cats") for thousands of years
longer with little to no impact on its population, suggesting that either the
cassowaries of New Guinea had long adapted to human-introduced species or that
the rich biodiversity of New Guinea allowed for additional [niche
partitioning](/wiki/Niche\_partition "Niche partition").[61]

As for eating the cassowary, it is supposed to be quite tough. Australian
administrative officers stationed in New Guinea were advised that it "should
be cooked with a stone in the pot: when the stone is ready to eat, so is the
cassowary".[62]
