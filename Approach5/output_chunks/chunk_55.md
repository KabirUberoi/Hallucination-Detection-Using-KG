"Edit section: U.S. ratings")]

\_The Big Bang Theory\_ started off slowly in the ratings, failing to make the
top 50 in its first season (ranking 68th), and ranking 40th in its second
season. When the third season premiered on September 21, 2009, however, \_The
Big Bang Theory\_ ranked as CBS's highest-rated show of that evening in the
adults 18–49 demographic (4.6/10) along with a then-series-high 12.83 million
viewers.[156] After the first three seasons aired at different times on Monday
nights, CBS moved the show to Thursdays at 8:00 ET for the [2010–2011
schedule](/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311\_United\_States\_network\_television\_schedule
"2010–11 United States network television schedule"), to be in direct
competition with [NBC](/wiki/NBC "NBC")'s [Comedy Block](/wiki/Must\_See\_TV
"Must See TV") and [Fox](/wiki/Fox\_Broadcasting\_Company "Fox Broadcasting
Company")'s \_[American Idol](/wiki/American\_Idol "American Idol")\_ (then the
longest reigning leading primetime show on U.S. television from 2004 to
2011).[157] During its fourth season, it became television's highest rated
comedy, just barely beating out \_[Two and a Half Men](/wiki/Two\_and\_a\_Half\_Men
"Two and a Half Men")\_ (which held the position for the past 8 years).
However, in the age 18–49 demographic (the show's target age range), it was
the second highest-rated comedy, behind
[ABC](/wiki/American\_Broadcasting\_Company "American Broadcasting Company")'s
\_[Modern Family](/wiki/Modern\_Family "Modern Family")\_. The fifth season
opened with viewing figures of over 14 million.[158]

The sixth season boasts some of the highest-rated episodes for the show so
far, with a then-new series high set with "[The Bakersfield
Expedition](/wiki/The\_Big\_Bang\_Theory\_season\_6#ep124 "The Big Bang Theory
season 6")", with 20 million viewers,[159] a first for the series, which along
with \_[NCIS](/wiki/NCIS\_\(TV\_series\) "NCIS \(TV series\)")\_ , made CBS the
first network to have two scripted series reach that large an audience in the
same week since 2007. In the sixth season, the show became the highest rated
and viewed scripted show in the 18–49 demographic, trailing only the live
regular \_[NBC Sunday Night Football](/wiki/NBC\_Sunday\_Night\_Football "NBC
Sunday Night Football")\_ coverage,[160][161] and was third in total viewers,
trailing \_NCIS\_ and \_Sunday Night Football\_.[162] Season seven of the series
opened strong, continuing the success gained in season six, with the second
episode of the premiere, "[The Deception
Verification](/wiki/The\_Big\_Bang\_Theory\_season\_7#ep137 "The Big Bang Theory
season 7")", setting the new series high in viewers with 20.44
million.[163][164]

Showrunner Steve Molaro, who took over from Bill Prady with the sixth season,
credits some of the show's success to the sitcom's exposure in [off-network
syndication](/wiki/Broadcast\_syndication#Off-network\_syndication "Broadcast
syndication"), particularly on [TBS](/wiki/TBS\_\(U.S.\_TV\_channel\) "TBS \(U.S.
TV channel\)"), while Michael Schneider of \_[TV Guide](/wiki/TV\_Guide "TV
Guide")\_ attributes it to the timeslot move two seasons earlier. Chuck Lorre
and CBS Entertainment president Nina Tassler also credit the success to the
influence of Molaro, in particular the deepening exploration of the firmly
established regular characters and their interpersonal relationships, such as
the on-again, off-again relationship between Leonard and Penny.[165]
Throughout much of the 2012–13 season, \_The Big Bang Theory\_ placed first in
all of the syndication ratings, receiving formidable competition from only
\_[Judge Judy](/wiki/Judge\_Judy "Judge Judy")\_ and \_[Wheel of
Fortune](/wiki/Wheel\_of\_Fortune\_\(American\_game\_show\) "Wheel of Fortune
\(American game show\)")\_ ([first-run syndication](/wiki/First-run\_syndication
"First-run syndication") programs). By the end of the 2012–13 television
season, \_The Big Bang Theory\_ had dethroned \_Judge Judy\_ as the ratings leader
in all of the syndicated programming with 7.1, \_Judy\_ descending to second
place for that season with a 7.0.[166] \_The Big Bang Theory\_ did not place
first in syndication ratings for the 2013–14 television season, beaten out by
\_[Judge Judy](/wiki/Judge\_Judy "Judge Judy")\_.[167]
