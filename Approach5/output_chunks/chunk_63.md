In November 2016, it was reported that CBS was in negotiations to create a
spin-off of \_The Big Bang Theory\_ centered on Sheldon as a young boy. The
prequel series, described as "a \_[Malcolm in the
Middle](/wiki/Malcolm\_in\_the\_Middle "Malcolm in the Middle")\_ -esque [single-
camera](/wiki/Single-camera\_setup "Single-camera setup") family comedy" would
be executive-produced by Lorre and Molaro, with Prady expected to be involved
in some capacity, and intended to air in the [2017–18
season](/wiki/2017%E2%80%9318\_United\_States\_network\_television\_schedule
"2017–18 United States network television schedule") alongside \_The Big Bang
Theory\_.[227][228] The initial idea for the series came from Parsons, who
passed it along to \_The Big Bang Theory\_ producers.[229] In early March 2017,
[Iain Armitage](/wiki/Iain\_Armitage "Iain Armitage") was cast as the younger
Sheldon, as well as [Zoe Perry](/wiki/Zoe\_Perry "Zoe Perry") as his mother,
Mary Cooper. Perry is the real-life daughter of [Laurie
Metcalf](/wiki/Laurie\_Metcalf "Laurie Metcalf"), who portrays Mary Cooper on
\_The Big Bang Theory\_.[229]

On March 13, 2017, CBS ordered the spin-off \_Young Sheldon\_ series. [Jon
Favreau](/wiki/Jon\_Favreau "Jon Favreau") directed and executive produced the
pilot. Created by Lorre and Molaro, the series follows 9-year-old Sheldon
Cooper as he attends high school in East Texas. Alongside Armitage as 9-year-
old Sheldon Cooper and Perry as Mary Cooper, [Lance Barber](/wiki/Lance\_Barber
"Lance Barber") stars as George Cooper, Sheldon's father; Raegan Revord stars
as Missy Cooper, Sheldon's twin sister; and [Montana
Jordan](/wiki/Montana\_Jordan "Montana Jordan") stars as George Cooper Jr.,
Sheldon's older brother. Jim Parsons reprises his role as adult Sheldon
Cooper, as narrator for the series. Parsons, Lorre, Molaro and Todd Spiewak
also serve as executive producers on the series, for [Chuck Lorre
Productions](/wiki/Chuck\_Lorre\_Productions "Chuck Lorre Productions") and
[Warner Bros. Television](/wiki/Warner\_Bros.\_Television "Warner Bros.
Television").[230] The show's pilot episode premiered on September 25, 2017.
Subsequent weekly episodes began airing on November 2, 2017, following the
broadcast of the 237th episode of \_The Big Bang Theory\_.[231]

Armitage appeared on the series' 265th episode, "The VCR Illumination", by way
of a videotape recorded by the younger Sheldon and viewed by the current-day
Sheldon.

On January 6, 2018, the show was renewed for a second season.[232] On February
22, 2019, CBS renewed the series for both the third and fourth seasons.[233]
On March 30, 2021, CBS renewed the series for a fifth, sixth, and seventh
season.[234]

The prequel series came to an end on May 16, 2024, with an hour long episode
which included George Cooper's funeral and a cameo from Jim and Mayim as their
older characters. We learn that Young Sheldon has been a memoir of Sheldon's
life all along.
