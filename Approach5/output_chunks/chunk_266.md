The cassowary breeding season starts in May to June. Females lay three to
eight large, bright green or pale green-blue [eggs](/wiki/Bird\_egg "Bird egg")
in each clutch into a heap of leaf litter prepared by the male.[27] The eggs
measure about 9 by 14 cm (3.5 by 5.5 in) – only ostrich and emu eggs are
larger.

The male [incubates](/wiki/Avian\_incubation "Avian incubation") those eggs for
50–52 days, removing or adding litter to regulate the temperature, then
protects the chicks, which stay in the nest for about 9 months. He defends
them fiercely against all potential predators, including humans. The young
males later go off to find a territory of their own.[27]

The female does not care for the eggs or the chicks, but rather moves on
within her territory to lay eggs in the nests of several other males. Young
cassowaries are brown and have buffy stripes. They are often kept as pets in
native villages (in New Guinea), where they are permitted to roam like
barnyard fowl until nearing maturity. Caged birds are regularly bereft of
their fresh plumes.[28]
