### Theory of mind (ToM)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Theory-
theory&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Theory of mind \(ToM\)")]

\_Theory-theory\_ is closely related to [theory of mind](/wiki/Theory\_of\_mind
"Theory of mind") (ToM), which concerns mental states of people, but differs
from ToM in that the full scope of \_theory-theory\_ also concerns mechanical
devices or other objects, beyond just thinking about people and their
viewpoints.[\_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed
