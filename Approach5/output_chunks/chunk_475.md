Despite being a genuinely pious Roman Catholic,[28] Galileo fathered three
children out of wedlock with [Marina Gamba](/wiki/Marina\_Gamba "Marina
Gamba"). They had two daughters, Virginia (born 1600) and Livia (born 1601),
and a son, [Vincenzo](/wiki/Vincenzo\_Gamba "Vincenzo Gamba") (born 1606).[29]

Due to their illegitimate birth, Galileo considered the girls unmarriageable,
if not posing problems of prohibitively expensive support or dowries, which
would have been similar to Galileo's previous extensive financial problems
with two of his sisters.[30] Their only worthy alternative was the religious
life. Both girls were accepted by the convent of San Matteo in
[Arcetri](/wiki/Arcetri "Arcetri") and remained there for the rest of their
lives.[31]

Virginia took the name [Maria Celeste](/wiki/Maria\_Celeste "Maria Celeste")
upon entering the convent. She died on 2 April 1634, and is buried with
Galileo at the [Basilica of Santa Croce,
Florence](/wiki/Basilica\_of\_Santa\_Croce,\_Florence "Basilica of Santa Croce,
Florence"). Livia took the name Sister Arcangela and was ill for most of her
life. Vincenzo was later [legitimised](/wiki/Legitimation "Legitimation") as
the legal heir of Galileo and married Sestilia Bocchineri.[32]
