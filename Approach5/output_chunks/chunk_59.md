On March 16, 2014, a [Lego Ideas](/wiki/Lego\_Ideas "Lego Ideas") project[221]
portraying the living room scene in [Lego](/wiki/Lego "Lego") style with the
main cast as mini-figures reached 10,000 supporters on the platform, which
qualified it to be considered as an official set by the [Lego
Ideas](/wiki/Lego\_Ideas "Lego Ideas") review board. On November 7, 2014, Lego
Ideas approved the design and began refining it. The set was released in
August 2015, with an exclusive pre-sale taking place at the [San Diego Comic-
Con International](/wiki/San\_Diego\_Comic-Con\_International "San Diego Comic-
Con International").[\_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed
