### Versus theorems[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Theory&action=edit&section=5
"Edit section: Versus theorems")]

Theories are distinct from [theorems](/wiki/Theorem "Theorem"). A \_theorem\_ is
[derived](/wiki/Formal\_proof "Formal proof") deductively from
[axioms](/wiki/Axiom "Axiom") (basic assumptions) according to a [formal
system](/wiki/Formal\_system "Formal system") of rules, sometimes as an end in
itself and sometimes as a first step toward being tested or applied in a
concrete situation; theorems are said to be true in the sense that the
conclusions of a theorem are logical consequences of the axioms. \_Theories\_
are abstract and conceptual, and are supported or challenged by observations
in the world. They are '[rigorously](/wiki/Rigor "Rigor") tentative', meaning
that they are proposed as true and expected to satisfy careful examination to
account for the possibility of faulty inference or incorrect observation.
Sometimes theories are incorrect, meaning that an explicit set of observations
contradicts some fundamental objection or application of the theory, but more
often theories are corrected to conform to new observations, by restricting
the class of phenomena the theory applies to or changing the assertions made.
An example of the former is the restriction of classical mechanics to
phenomena involving macroscopic length scales and particle speeds much lower
than the speed of light.
