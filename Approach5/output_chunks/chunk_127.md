### Metagames[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Game\_theory&action=edit&section=18
"Edit section: Metagames")]

These are games the play of which is the development of the rules for another
game, the target or subject game. [Metagames](/wiki/Metagame "Metagame") seek
to maximize the utility value of the rule set developed. The theory of
metagames is related to [mechanism design](/wiki/Mechanism\_design "Mechanism
design") theory.

The term [metagame analysis](/wiki/Metagame\_analysis "Metagame analysis") is
also used to refer to a practical approach developed by Nigel Howard,[44]
whereby a situation is framed as a strategic game in which stakeholders try to
realize their objectives by means of the options available to them. Subsequent
developments have led to the formulation of [confrontation
analysis](/wiki/Confrontation\_analysis "Confrontation analysis").
