## Distribution and
habitat[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cassowary&action=edit&section=9 "Edit
section: Distribution and habitat")]

Cassowaries are native to the humid rainforests of New Guinea, nearby smaller
islands, [East Nusa Tenggara](/wiki/East\_Nusa\_Tenggara "East Nusa Tenggara"),
the [Maluku Islands](/wiki/Maluku\_Islands "Maluku Islands"), and northeastern
Australia.[5] They do, however, venture out into palm scrub,
[grassland](/wiki/Grassland "Grassland"), [savanna](/wiki/Savanna "Savanna"),
and swamp forest. Whether some island populations are natural or the result of
human trade in young birds is unclear.[27] They can also be easily spotted in
some national parks such as Mellwraith Range National Park, [Paluma Range
National Park](/wiki/Paluma\_Range\_National\_Park "Paluma Range National Park"),
and Jardine National Park in Australia.[63]
