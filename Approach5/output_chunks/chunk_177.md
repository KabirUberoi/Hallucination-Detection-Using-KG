## Origin and
usage[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Conspiracy\_theory&action=edit&section=1 "Edit
section: Origin and usage")]

The \_[Oxford English Dictionary](/wiki/Oxford\_English\_Dictionary "Oxford
English Dictionary")\_ defines \_conspiracy theory\_ as "the theory that an event
or phenomenon occurs as a result of a conspiracy between interested parties;
\_spec.\_ a belief that some covert but influential agency (typically political
in motivation and oppressive in intent) is responsible for an unexplained
event". It cites a 1909 article in \_[The American Historical
Review](/wiki/The\_American\_Historical\_Review "The American Historical
Review")\_ as the earliest usage example,[51][52] although it also appeared in
print for several decades before.[53]

The earliest known usage was by the American author [Charles Astor
Bristed](/wiki/Charles\_Astor\_Bristed "Charles Astor Bristed"), in a letter to
the editor published in \_[The New York Times](/wiki/The\_New\_York\_Times "The
New York Times")\_ on January 11, 1863.[54] He used it to refer to claims that
British aristocrats were intentionally [weakening the United States during the
American Civil War](/wiki/United\_Kingdom\_and\_the\_American\_Civil\_War "United
Kingdom and the American Civil War") in order to advance their financial
interests.

The term is also used as a way to discredit
[dissenting](/wiki/Dissenting\_opinion "Dissenting opinion") analyses.[55]
Robert Blaskiewicz comments that examples of the term were used as early as
the nineteenth century and states that its usage has always been
derogatory.[56] According to a study by Andrew McKenzie-McHarg, in contrast,
in the nineteenth century the term \_conspiracy theory\_ simply "suggests a
plausible postulate of a conspiracy" and "did not, at this stage, carry any
connotations, either negative or positive", though sometimes a postulate so-
labeled was criticized.[57]

The author and activist [George Monbiot](/wiki/George\_Monbiot "George
Monbiot") argued that the terms "conspiracy theory" and "conspiracy theorist"
are misleading, as conspiracies truly exist and [theories](/wiki/Theories
"Theories") are "rational explanations subject to disproof". Instead, he
proposed the terms "conspiracy fiction" and "conspiracy fantasist".[58]
