Research in physics is continually progressing on a large number of fronts.

In condensed matter physics, an important unsolved theoretical problem is that
of [high-temperature superconductivity](/wiki/High-
temperature\_superconductivity "High-temperature superconductivity").[94] Many
condensed matter experiments are aiming to fabricate workable
[spintronics](/wiki/Spintronics "Spintronics") and [quantum
computers](/wiki/Quantum\_computer "Quantum computer").[81][95]

In particle physics, the first pieces of experimental evidence for physics
beyond the Standard Model have begun to appear. Foremost among these are
indications that [neutrinos](/wiki/Neutrino "Neutrino") have non-zero
[mass](/wiki/Mass "Mass"). These experimental results appear to have solved
the long-standing [solar neutrino problem](/wiki/Solar\_neutrino\_problem "Solar
neutrino problem"), and the physics of massive neutrinos remains an area of
active theoretical and experimental research. The Large Hadron Collider has
already found the Higgs boson, but future research aims to prove or disprove
the [supersymmetry](/wiki/Supersymmetry "Supersymmetry"), which extends the
Standard Model of particle physics. Research on the nature of the major
mysteries of dark matter and [dark energy](/wiki/Dark\_energy "Dark energy") is
also currently ongoing.[96]

Although much progress has been made in high-energy, [quantum](/wiki/Quantum
"Quantum"), and astronomical physics, many everyday phenomena involving
[complexity](/wiki/Complex\_system "Complex system"),[97] chaos,[98] or
[turbulence](/wiki/Turbulence "Turbulence")[99] are still poorly understood.
Complex problems that seem like they could be solved by a clever application
of dynamics and mechanics remain unsolved; examples include the formation of
sandpiles, nodes in trickling water, the shape of water droplets, mechanisms
of [surface tension](/wiki/Surface\_tension "Surface tension")
[catastrophes](/wiki/Catastrophe\_theory "Catastrophe theory"), and self-
sorting in shaken heterogeneous collections.[g][100]

These complex phenomena have received growing attention since the 1970s for
several reasons, including the availability of modern mathematical methods and
computers, which enabled complex systems to be modeled in new ways. Complex
physics has become part of increasingly interdisciplinary research, as
exemplified by the study of turbulence in aerodynamics and the observation of
[pattern formation](/wiki/Pattern\_formation "Pattern formation") in biological
systems. In the 1932 \_Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics\_ , [Horace
Lamb](/wiki/Horace\_Lamb "Horace Lamb") said:[101]

> I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters
> on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the
> other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And about the former I am rather
> optimistic.
