### Religious
beliefs[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Simone\_and\_Malcolm\_Collins&action=edit&section=7
"Edit section: Religious beliefs")]

The Collinses have sometimes stated they are atheist,[30] but also promulgate
a theology they call "Techno-Puritanism". They base Techno-Puritanism on the
book \_The Martyrdom Of Man\_ by [William Winwood
Reade](/wiki/William\_Winwood\_Reade "William Winwood Reade") as well as the
[Bible](/wiki/Bible "Bible"); they consider both of these works divinely
inspired scripture.[38]
