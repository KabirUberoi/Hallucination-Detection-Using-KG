paradox")

There are many alternative scenarios that might allow for the evolution of
intelligent life to occur multiple times without either catastrophic self-
destruction or glaringly visible evidence. These are possible resolutions to
the [Fermi paradox](/wiki/Fermi\_paradox "Fermi paradox"): "They do exist, but
we see no evidence". Other ideas include: it is too expensive to spread
physically throughout the galaxy; Earth is purposely isolated; it is dangerous
to communicate and hence civilizations actively hide, among others.

Astrobiologists [Dirk Schulze-Makuch](/wiki/Dirk\_Schulze-Makuch "Dirk Schulze-
Makuch") and William Bains, reviewing the history of life on Earth, including
[convergent evolution](/wiki/Convergent\_evolution "Convergent evolution"),
concluded that transitions such as [oxygenic
photosynthesis](/wiki/Oxygenic\_photosynthesis "Oxygenic photosynthesis"), the
[eukaryotic cell](/wiki/Eukaryote "Eukaryote"),
[multicellularity](/wiki/Multicellularity "Multicellularity"), and
[tool](/wiki/Tool "Tool")-using [intelligence](/wiki/Intelligence
"Intelligence") are likely to occur on any Earth-like planet given enough
time. They argue that the Great Filter may be [abiogenesis](/wiki/Abiogenesis
"Abiogenesis"), the rise of technological human-level intelligence, or an
inability to settle other worlds because of self-destruction or a lack of
resources.[9]

Astronomer [Seth Shostak](/wiki/Seth\_Shostak "Seth Shostak") of the [SETI
Institute](/wiki/SETI\_Institute "SETI Institute") argues that one can
postulate a galaxy filled with intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations that
have failed to colonize [Earth](/wiki/Earth "Earth"). Perhaps the
[aliens](/wiki/Extraterrestrial\_life "Extraterrestrial life") lacked the
intent and purpose to colonize or depleted their resources, or maybe the
[galaxy](/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy") \_is\_ colonized but in a
[heterogeneous](/wiki/Heterogeneous "Heterogeneous") manner, or the Earth
could be located in a "galactic backwater". Although absence of evidence
generally is only weak [evidence of absence](/wiki/Evidence\_of\_absence
"Evidence of absence"), the absence of extraterrestrial [megascale
engineering](/wiki/Megascale\_engineering "Megascale engineering") projects,
for example, might point to the Great Filter at work. Does this mean that one
of the steps leading to intelligent life is unlikely?[10] According to
Shostak:

> stars in their neighborhoods, for instance. They may prefer to build
> nanobots instead. It should also be kept in mind that, as [Arthur C.

> engineering would look like magic to usâ€”or be unrecognizable altogether. By
