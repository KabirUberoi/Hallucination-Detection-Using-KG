Many researchers state that a torn hymen is not a reliable indicator that a
female has been vaginally penetrated because the tearing of the hymen may have
been the result of some other event.[21] Furthermore, in rare cases, some
people are born without hymens.[44][45]

The hymen is a ring of fleshy tissue that sits just inside the vaginal
opening. Normal variations range from thin and stretchy to thick and somewhat
rigid.[44][45] The only variation that typically requires medical intervention
is the imperforate hymen, which either completely prevents the passage of
menstrual fluid or slows it significantly. In either case, surgical
intervention may be needed to allow menstrual fluid to pass or intercourse to
take place at all. Another variation, the septate hymen (a condition in which
a band of tissue divides the vaginal canal in two) may also require medical
intervention if it does not resolve naturally through sexual intercourse or
other means. It is a misconception that the hymen always tears during first
intercourse or that intercourse is required to rupture the hymen.

A female can undergo a surgical procedure, called
[hymenorrhaphy](/wiki/Hymenorrhaphy "Hymenorrhaphy") or hymenoplasty, to
repair or replace a torn hymen, to "pass" a virginity test.[46]
