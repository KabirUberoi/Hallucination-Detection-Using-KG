(1824–1907)

In the 19th century, the connection between heat and mechanical energy was
established quantitatively by [Julius Robert von
Mayer](/wiki/Julius\_Robert\_von\_Mayer "Julius Robert von Mayer") and [James
Prescott Joule](/wiki/James\_Prescott\_Joule "James Prescott Joule"), who
measured the mechanical equivalent of heat in the 1840s. In 1849, Joule
published results from his series of experiments (including the paddlewheel
experiment) which show that heat is a form of energy, a fact that was accepted
in the 1850s. The relation between heat and energy was important for the
development of steam engines, and in 1824 the experimental and theoretical
work of [Sadi Carnot](/wiki/Nicolas\_L%C3%A9onard\_Sadi\_Carnot "Nicolas Léonard
Sadi Carnot") was published. Carnot captured some of the ideas of
thermodynamics in his discussion of the efficiency of an idealized engine.
Sadi Carnot's work provided a basis for the formulation of the [first law of
thermodynamics](/wiki/First\_law\_of\_thermodynamics "First law of
thermodynamics")—a restatement of the [law of conservation of
energy](/wiki/Law\_of\_conservation\_of\_energy "Law of conservation of
energy")—which was stated around 1850 by [William
Thomson](/wiki/William\_Thomson,\_1st\_Baron\_Kelvin "William Thomson, 1st Baron
Kelvin"), later known as Lord Kelvin, and [Rudolf
Clausius](/wiki/Rudolf\_Clausius "Rudolf Clausius"). Lord Kelvin, who had
extended the concept of absolute zero from gases to all substances in 1848,
drew upon the engineering theory of [Lazare Carnot](/wiki/Lazare\_Carnot
"Lazare Carnot"), Sadi Carnot, and [Émile
Clapeyron](/wiki/%C3%89mile\_Clapeyron "Émile Clapeyron")–as well as the
experimentation of James Prescott Joule on the interchangeability of
mechanical, chemical, thermal, and electrical forms of work—to formulate the
first law.

Kelvin and Clausius also stated the [second law of
thermodynamics](/wiki/Second\_law\_of\_thermodynamics "Second law of
thermodynamics"), which was originally formulated in terms of the fact that
heat does not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter. Other
formulations followed quickly (for example, the second law was expounded in
Thomson and [Peter Guthrie Tait](/wiki/Peter\_Guthrie\_Tait "Peter Guthrie
Tait")'s influential work \_Treatise on Natural Philosophy\_) and Kelvin in
particular understood some of the law's general implications. The second
Law–the idea that gases consist of molecules in motion–had been discussed in
some detail by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738, but had fallen out of favor, and was
revived by Clausius in 1857. In 1850, [Hippolyte
Fizeau](/wiki/Hippolyte\_Fizeau "Hippolyte Fizeau") and [Léon
Foucault](/wiki/L%C3%A9on\_Foucault "Léon Foucault") measured the [speed of
light](/wiki/Speed\_of\_light "Speed of light") in water and find that it is
slower than in air, in support of the wave model of light. In 1852, Joule and
Thomson demonstrated that a rapidly expanding gas cools, later named the
[Joule–Thomson effect](/wiki/Joule%E2%80%93Thomson\_effect "Joule–Thomson
effect") or Joule–Kelvin effect. [Hermann von
Helmholtz](/wiki/Hermann\_von\_Helmholtz "Hermann von Helmholtz") puts forward
the idea of the [heat death of the universe](/wiki/Heat\_death\_of\_the\_universe
"Heat death of the universe") in 1854, the same year that Clausius established
the importance of \_dQ/T\_ ([Clausius's theorem](/wiki/Clausius%27s\_theorem
"Clausius's theorem")) (though he did not yet name the quantity).
