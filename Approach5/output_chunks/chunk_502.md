In 1586, [Simon Stevin](/wiki/Simon\_Stevin "Simon Stevin") (commonly known as
Stevinus) and [Jan Cornets de Groot](/wiki/Jan\_Cornets\_de\_Groot "Jan Cornets
de Groot") dropped lead balls from the [Nieuwe
Kerk](/wiki/Nieuwe\_Kerk\_\(Delft\) "Nieuwe Kerk \(Delft\)") in the Dutch city
of [Delft](/wiki/Delft "Delft"). The experiment established that objects of
identical size, but different masses, fall at the same speed.[34][206] While
the Delft tower experiment had been a success, it was not conducted with the
same scientific rigor that later experiments were. Stevin was forced to rely
on audio feedback (caused by the spheres impacting a wooden platform below) to
deduce that the balls had fallen at the same speed. The experiment was given
less credence than the more substantive work of Galileo Galilei and his famous
Leaning Tower of Pisa thought experiment of 1589.
