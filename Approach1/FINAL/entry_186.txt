Ground Truth : 
philip 29 august 1116 13 october 1131 was the king of france from 1129 coruling with his father louis vi. his mother was louis vis second wife adelaide of maurienne. the favourite son of his father as a child philip was enthroned alongside louis vi as joint king in 1129. however the young king gave his father little joy after that refusing to pay attention to the old king or to follow the high standards that louis himself followed. he became disobedient refusing to heed scoldings or warnings walter map said that he strayed from the paths of conduct travelled by his father and by his overweening pride and tyrannical arrogance made himself a burden to all. philips brief period as king was ended two years after his coronation. riding with a group of companions along the seine in the parisian market section named the greve his running horse was tripped by a black pig which darted out of a dung heap on the quay. the horse fell forwards and the young king was catapulted over its head. the fall so dreadfully fractured his limbs that he died on the day following without regaining consciousness. he was buried at st denis and succeeded as heir and coking by his pious brother louis the younger now known as louis vii. if philip had been little other than trouble and a problem to his family and kingdom whilst he had lived his legacy would prove greater trouble still. whilst he had lived he had nurtured a dream of visiting jerusalem and the tomb of christ when he died his brother louis vii vowed to go in philips place. this vow would provide a reason for louis joining the disastrous second crusade and an excuse to abandon antioch in favour of jerusalem. the crusade brought many deaths on both sides and the abandonment of antioch proved a strategic failure and a partial cause for the collapse of the marriage between louis and his wife eleanor of aquitaine. because he was coking rather than a king in his own right he is not generally given a number in the succession of kings of france.
