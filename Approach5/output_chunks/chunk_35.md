The show's pilot episode premiered on September 24, 2007. This was the second
pilot produced for the show. A different pilot was produced for the [2006–07
television
season](/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307\_United\_States\_network\_television\_schedule
"2006–07 United States network television schedule") but never aired. The
structure of the original unaired pilot was different from the series' current
form. The only main characters retained in both pilots were Leonard ([Johnny
Galecki](/wiki/Johnny\_Galecki "Johnny Galecki")) and Sheldon ([Jim
Parsons](/wiki/Jim\_Parsons "Jim Parsons")), who are named after [Sheldon
Leonard](/wiki/Sheldon\_Leonard "Sheldon Leonard"), a longtime figure in
episodic television as a producer, director, and actor. A minor character,
Althea ([Vernee Watson](/wiki/Vernee\_Watson "Vernee Watson")), appeared in the
first scene of both pilots that was retained generally as-is.[33] The first
pilot included two female lead characters - Katie, "a street-hardened, tough-
as-nails woman with a vulnerable interior" (played by Canadian actress [Amanda
Walsh](/wiki/Amanda\_Walsh "Amanda Walsh")),[34][35] and Gilda, a scientist
colleague and friend of the male characters (played by [Iris
Bahr](/wiki/Iris\_Bahr "Iris Bahr")). Sheldon and Leonard meet Katie after she
breaks up with a boyfriend, and they invite her to share their apartment.
Gilda is threatened by Katie's presence. Test audiences reacted negatively to
Katie, but they liked Sheldon and Leonard. The original pilot used [Thomas
Dolby](/wiki/Thomas\_Dolby "Thomas Dolby")'s hit "[She Blinded Me with
Science](/wiki/She\_Blinded\_Me\_with\_Science "She Blinded Me with Science")" as
its theme song.

Although the original pilot was not picked up, its creators were given an
opportunity to retool it and produce a second pilot. They brought in the
remaining cast and retooled the show to its final format. Katie was replaced
by Penny ([Kaley Cuoco](/wiki/Kaley\_Cuoco "Kaley Cuoco")). The original
unaired pilot has never been officially released, but it has circulated on the
Internet.[\_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed
"Wikipedia:Citation needed")\_] On the evolution of the show, [Chuck
Lorre](/wiki/Chuck\_Lorre "Chuck Lorre") said, "We did the 'Big Bang Pilot'
about two and a half years ago, and it sucked ... but there were two
remarkable things that worked perfectly, and that was Johnny and Jim. We
rewrote the thing entirely, and then we were blessed with Kaley and Simon and
Kunal." As to whether the world will ever see the original pilot on a future
DVD release, Lorre said, "Wow, that would be something. We will see. Show your
failures..."[36]

The first and second pilots of \_The Big Bang Theory\_ were directed by [James
Burrows](/wiki/James\_Burrows "James Burrows"), who did not continue with the
show. The reworked second pilot led to a 13-episode order by CBS on May 14,
2007.[37] Prior to its airing on [CBS](/wiki/CBS "CBS"), the pilot episode was
distributed on [iTunes](/wiki/ITunes\_Store "ITunes Store") free of charge. The
show premiered on September 24, 2007, and was picked up for a full 22-episode
season on October 19, 2007.[38] The show is filmed in front of a live
audience,[39] and it is produced by [Chuck Lorre
Productions](/wiki/Chuck\_Lorre\_Productions "Chuck Lorre Productions") and
[Warner Bros. Television](/wiki/Warner\_Bros.\_Television "Warner Bros.
Television").[40] Production was halted on November 6, 2007, due to the
[Writers Guild of America
strike](/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308\_Writers\_Guild\_of\_America\_strike "2007–08 Writers
Guild of America strike"). Nearly three months later, on February 4, 2008, the
series was temporarily replaced by a short-lived sitcom, \_[Welcome to The
Captain](/wiki/Welcome\_to\_The\_Captain "Welcome to The Captain")\_. The series
returned on March 17, 2008, in an earlier time slot,[41] and ultimately only
17 episodes were produced for the first season.[42][43]

After the strike ended, the show was picked up for a second season, airing in
the [2008–2009
season](/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309\_United\_States\_network\_television\_schedule
"2008–09 United States network television schedule"), premiering in the same
time slot on September 22, 2008.[44] With increasing ratings, the show
received a two-year renewal through the 2010–11 season in 2009.[45][46] In
2011, the show was picked up for three more seasons.[47] In March 2014, the
show was renewed again for three more years through the 2016–17 season. This
marked the second time the series gained a three-year renewal.[48] In March
2017, the series was renewed for two additional seasons, bringing its total to
12, and running through the 2018–19 television season.[49]

Several of the actors on \_The Big Bang Theory\_ previously worked together on
the sitcom \_[Roseanne](/wiki/Roseanne "Roseanne")\_ , including Johnny Galecki,
[Sara Gilbert](/wiki/Sara\_Gilbert "Sara Gilbert"), [Laurie
Metcalf](/wiki/Laurie\_Metcalf "Laurie Metcalf") (who plays Sheldon's mother,
[Mary Cooper](/wiki/List\_of\_The\_Big\_Bang\_Theory\_characters#Mary\_Cooper "List
of The Big Bang Theory characters")), and [Meagen Fay](/wiki/Meagen\_Fay
"Meagen Fay") (who plays
[Bernadette's](/wiki/List\_of\_The\_Big\_Bang\_Theory\_characters#Bernadette\_Maryann\_Rostenkowski-
Wolowitz "List of The Big Bang Theory characters") mother). Additionally,
Lorre was a writer on the series for several seasons.
