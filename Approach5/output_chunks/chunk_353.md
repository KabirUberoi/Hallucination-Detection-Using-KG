Physics deals with a wide variety of systems, although certain theories are
used by all physicists. Each of these theories was experimentally tested
numerous times and found to be an adequate approximation of nature. For
instance, the theory of [classical](/wiki/Classical\_physics "Classical
physics") mechanics accurately describes the motion of objects, provided they
are much larger than [atoms](/wiki/Atom "Atom") and moving at a speed much
less than the speed of light. These theories continue to be areas of active
research today. [Chaos theory](/wiki/Chaos\_theory "Chaos theory"), an aspect
of classical mechanics, was discovered in the 20th century, three centuries
after the original formulation of classical mechanics by Newton (1642â€“1727).

These central theories are important tools for research into more specialized
topics, and any physicist, regardless of their specialization, is expected to
be literate in them. These include classical mechanics, quantum mechanics,
thermodynamics and [statistical mechanics](/wiki/Statistical\_mechanics
"Statistical mechanics"), [electromagnetism](/wiki/Electromagnetism
"Electromagnetism"), and special relativity.
