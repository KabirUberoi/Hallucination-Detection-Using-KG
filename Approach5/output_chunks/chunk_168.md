Einstein stated that the theory of relativity belongs to a class of
"principle-theories". As such, it employs an analytic method, which means that
the elements of this theory are not based on hypothesis but on empirical
discovery. By observing natural processes, we understand their general
characteristics, devise mathematical models to describe what we observed, and
by analytical means we deduce the necessary conditions that have to be
satisfied. Measurement of separate events must satisfy these conditions and
match the theory's conclusions.[2]
