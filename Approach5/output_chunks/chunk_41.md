Trek: The Next Generation](/wiki/Star\_Trek:\_The\_Next\_Generation "Star Trek:
The Next Generation")\_ actor [Wil Wheaton](/wiki/Wil\_Wheaton "Wil Wheaton")
has a recurring role as a fictional version of himself on the show.

The four main male characters are all avid fans of [nerd
culture](/wiki/Nerd\_culture "Nerd culture"). Among their shared interests are
[science fiction](/wiki/Science\_fiction "Science fiction"),
[fantasy](/wiki/Fantasy "Fantasy"), comic books, and collecting memorabilia.

\_[Star Trek](/wiki/Star\_Trek "Star Trek")\_ in particular is referred to
frequently, and Sheldon identifies strongly with the character of
[Spock](/wiki/Spock "Spock"), so much so that when he is given a used napkin
signed by [Leonard Nimoy](/wiki/Leonard\_Nimoy "Leonard Nimoy") as a Christmas
gift from Penny, he is overwhelmed with excitement and gratitude ("I possess
the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!").[77] \_[Star Trek: The Original
Series](/wiki/Star\_Trek:\_The\_Original\_Series "Star Trek: The Original
Series")\_ cast members [William Shatner](/wiki/William\_Shatner "William
Shatner") and [George Takei](/wiki/George\_Takei "George Takei") have made
cameos, and Leonard Nimoy made a cameo as the voice of Sheldon's vintage Mr.
Spock action figure. \_[Star Trek: The Next
Generation](/wiki/Star\_Trek:\_The\_Next\_Generation "Star Trek: The Next
Generation")\_ cast members [Brent Spiner](/wiki/Brent\_Spiner "Brent Spiner")
and [LeVar Burton](/wiki/LeVar\_Burton "LeVar Burton") have had cameos as
themselves,[78][79] while [Wil Wheaton](/wiki/Wil\_Wheaton "Wil Wheaton") has a
recurring role as a [fictionalized version of
himself](/wiki/List\_of\_The\_Big\_Bang\_Theory\_characters#Wil\_Wheaton "List of The
Big Bang Theory characters"). Leonard and Sheldon have had conversations in
[Klingon](/wiki/Klingon\_language "Klingon language").

They are also fans of \_[Star Wars](/wiki/Star\_Wars "Star Wars")\_ ,
\_[Battlestar Galactica](/wiki/Battlestar\_Galactica "Battlestar Galactica")\_ ,
and \_[Doctor Who](/wiki/Doctor\_Who "Doctor Who")\_. [James Earl
Jones](/wiki/James\_Earl\_Jones "James Earl Jones"), [Carrie
Fisher](/wiki/Carrie\_Fisher "Carrie Fisher") and [Mark
Hamill](/wiki/Mark\_Hamill "Mark Hamill") make guest appearances. In the
episode "The Ornithophobia Diffusion", when there is a delay in watching \_Star
Wars\_ on Blu-ray, Howard complains, "If we don't start soon, [George
Lucas](/wiki/George\_Lucas "George Lucas") is going to change it again"
(referring to Lucas' controversial alterations to the films). In "The Hot
Troll Deviation", [Katee Sackhoff](/wiki/Katee\_Sackhoff "Katee Sackhoff") of
\_Battlestar Galactica\_ appeared as Howard's fantasy dream girl. The characters
have different tastes in franchises, with Sheldon praising
\_[Firefly](/wiki/Firefly\_\(TV\_series\) "Firefly \(TV series\)")\_ but
disapproving of Leonard's enjoyment of \_[Babylon 5](/wiki/Babylon\_5 "Babylon
5")\_.[80] With regard to fantasy, the four make frequent references to \_[The
Lord of the Rings](/wiki/The\_Lord\_of\_the\_Rings "The Lord of the Rings")\_ and
\_[Harry Potter](/wiki/Harry\_Potter "Harry Potter")\_ novels and movies.
Additionally, Howard can speak [Sindarin](/wiki/Sindarin "Sindarin"), one of
the two [Elvish](/wiki/Elvish\_languages "Elvish languages") languages from
\_The Lord of the Rings\_.

Wednesday night is the group's designated "comic book night"[81] because that
is the day of the week when new comic books are released. The comic book store
is run by fellow geek and recurring character Stuart. On a number of
occasions, the group members have dressed up as pop culture characters,
including [The Flash](/wiki/Flash\_\(comics\) "Flash \(comics\)"),
[Aquaman](/wiki/Aquaman "Aquaman"), [Frodo Baggins](/wiki/Frodo\_Baggins "Frodo
Baggins"), [Superman](/wiki/Superman "Superman"), [Batman](/wiki/Batman
"Batman"), [Spock](/wiki/Spock "Spock"), [The Doctor](/wiki/Fourth\_Doctor
"Fourth Doctor"), [Green Lantern](/wiki/Green\_Lantern "Green Lantern"), and
[Thor](/wiki/Thor\_\(Marvel\_Comics\) "Thor \(Marvel Comics\)").[82] As a
consequence of losing a bet to Stuart and Wil Wheaton, the group members are
forced to visit the comic book store dressed as [Catwoman](/wiki/Catwoman
"Catwoman"), [Wonder Woman](/wiki/Wonder\_Woman "Wonder Woman"),
[Batgirl](/wiki/Batgirl "Batgirl"), and [Supergirl](/wiki/Supergirl
"Supergirl").[83] [DC Comics](/wiki/DC\_Comics "DC Comics") announced that, to
promote its comics, the company would sponsor Sheldon wearing Green Lantern
T-shirts.[84]

Various games have been featured, as well as referred to, on the series (e.g.
\_[World of Warcraft](/wiki/World\_of\_Warcraft "World of Warcraft")\_ ,
\_[Halo](/wiki/Halo\_\(series\) "Halo \(series\)")\_ ,
\_[Mario](/wiki/Mario\_\(franchise\) "Mario \(franchise\)")\_ , [Donkey
Kong](/wiki/Donkey\_Kong "Donkey Kong"), etc.), including fictional games like
\_Mystic Warlords of Ka'a\_ (which became a reality in 2011)[85] and [Rock-
paper-scissors-lizard-Spock](/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock "Rock-
paper-scissors-lizard-Spock").
