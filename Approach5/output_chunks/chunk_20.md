theory")

A theory can be either \_descriptive\_ as in science, or \_prescriptive\_
([normative](/wiki/Normative\_ethics "Normative ethics")) as in philosophy.[21]
The latter are those whose subject matter consists not of empirical data, but
rather of [ideas](/wiki/Idea "Idea"). At least some of the elementary theorems
of a philosophical theory are statements whose truth cannot necessarily be
scientifically tested through [empirical observation](/wiki/Empiricism
"Empiricism").

A field of study is sometimes named a "theory" because its basis is some
initial set of assumptions describing the field's approach to the subject.
These assumptions are the elementary theorems of the particular theory, and
can be thought of as the axioms of that field. Some commonly known examples
include [set theory](/wiki/Set\_theory "Set theory") and [number
theory](/wiki/Number\_theory "Number theory"); however [literary
theory](/wiki/Literary\_theory "Literary theory"), [critical
theory](/wiki/Critical\_theory "Critical theory"), and [music
theory](/wiki/Music\_theory "Music theory") are also of the same form.
