Ground Truth : 

Admiral of the Fleet Matthew Aylmer, 1st Baron Aylmer (ca. 1650 - 18 August 1720) was a Royal Navy officer.
He was one of the captains who sent a letter to Prince William of Orange, who had just landed at Torbay, assuring the Prince of the captains' support the Prince's response ultimately led to the Royal Navy switching allegiance to the Prince and the Glorious Revolution of November 1688.
Aylmer saw action at the Battle of Bantry Bay in May 1689, at the Battle of Beachy Head in July 1690, and again at the Battle of Barfleur in May 1692 during the Nine Years' War.
Aylmer became Commander-in-Chief of the Navy on 12 November 1709.
However, when Aylmer met a French squadron and convoy, he was only able to capture one merchantman and the 56-gun "Superbe" the new Harley ministry used this failure as an excuse to remove him as Commander-in-Chief and did so a few months later.
Following the accession of George I and the appointment of the Townshend ministry, Aylmer was reappointed Commander-in-Chief on 5 November 1714.
He was also appointed Governor of Greenwich Hospital in this post he founded the Royal Hospital School for the sons of seamen.
