### Marriage and
children[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Simone\_and\_Malcolm\_Collins&action=edit&section=6
"Edit section: Marriage and children")]

The Collinses married after Malcolm proposed on [Reddit](/wiki/Reddit
"Reddit") in 2013.[35][4]

The Collinses have stated that they plan to have seven to thirteen children
total.[1][36] As of 2024, they have four children.[18] The Collinses refuse to
give their daughters traditionally feminine names, because they believe social
research shows that women with feminine names are taken less seriously.[2][30]
Beginning with their third child, the Collinses have used preimplantation
genetic testing during [in vitro fertilisation](/wiki/In\_vitro\_fertilisation
"In vitro fertilisation") to select embryos with a desirable genetic
makeup.[1][22][18] The Collinses claim that every decision they make is backed
by data.[30] The Collinses also employ [corporal
punishment](/wiki/Corporal\_punishment\_in\_the\_home "Corporal punishment in the
home") in disciplining their children, which is based on Simone's personal
observation of lions and tigers during a safari trip.[30][37]
