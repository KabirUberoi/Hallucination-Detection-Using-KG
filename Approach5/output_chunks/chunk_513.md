### Personal
library[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Galileo\_Galilei&action=edit&section=41 "Edit
section: Personal library")]

In the last years of his life, Galileo Galilei kept a library of at least 598
volumes (560 of which have been identified) at [Villa Il
Gioiello](/wiki/Villa\_Il\_Gioiello "Villa Il Gioiello"), on the outskirts of
Florence.[252] Under the restrictions of house arrest, he was forbidden to
write or publish his ideas. However, he continued to receive visitors right up
to his death and it was through them that he remained supplied with the latest
scientific texts from Northern Europe.[253]

With his past experience, Galileo may have feared that his collection of books
and manuscripts would be seized by the authorities and burned, as no reference
to such items was made in his last will and testament. An itemized inventory
was only later produced after Galileo's death, when the majority of his
possessions including his library passed to his son, Vincenzo Galilei Jr. On
his death in 1649, the collection was inherited by his wife Sestilia
Bocchineri.[253]

Galileo's books, personal papers and unedited manuscripts were then collected
by [Vincenzo Viviani](/wiki/Vincenzo\_Viviani "Vincenzo Viviani"), his former
assistant and student, with the intent of preserving his old teacher's works
in published form. It was a project that never materialised and in his final
will, Viviani bequeathed a significant portion of the collection to the
[Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova](/wiki/Hospital\_of\_Santa\_Maria\_Nuova "Hospital
of Santa Maria Nuova") in Florence, where there already existed an extensive
library. The value of Galileo's possessions was not realised, and duplicate
copies were dispersed to other libraries, such as the [Biblioteca Comunale
degli Intronati](/wiki/Biblioteca\_Comunale\_degli\_Intronati "Biblioteca
Comunale degli Intronati"), the public library in Sienna. In a later attempt
to specialise the library's holdings, volumes unrelated to medicine were
transferred to the Biblioteca Magliabechiana, an early foundation for what was
to become the \_Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze\_ , the [National
Central Library](/wiki/National\_Central\_Library\_\(Florence\) "National Central
Library \(Florence\)") in Florence.[253]

A small portion of Viviani's collection, including the manuscripts of Galileo
and those of his peers [Evangelista Torricelli](/wiki/Evangelista\_Torricelli
"Evangelista Torricelli") and [Benedetto Castelli](/wiki/Benedetto\_Castelli
"Benedetto Castelli"), were left to his nephew, Abbot Jacopo Panzanini. This
minor collection was preserved until Panzanini's death when it passed to his
great-nephews, Carlo and Angelo Panzanini. The books from both Galileo and
Viviani's collections began to disperse as the heirs failed to protect their
inheritance. Their servants sold several of the volumes for waste paper.
Around 1750 the Florentine senator Giovanni Battista Clemente de'Nelli heard
of this and purchased the books and manuscripts from the shopkeepers, and the
remainder of Viviani's collection from the Panzanini brothers. As recounted in
Nelli's memoirs: \_"My great fortune in obtaining such a wonderful treasure so
cheaply came about through the ignorance of the people selling it, who were
not aware of the value of those manuscripts..."\_

The library remained in Nelli's care until his death in 1793. Knowing the
value of their father's collected manuscripts, Nelli's sons attempted to sell
what was left to them to the French government. [Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of
Tuscany](/wiki/Ferdinand\_III,\_Grand\_Duke\_of\_Tuscany "Ferdinand III, Grand Duke
of Tuscany") intervened in the sale and purchased the entire collection. The
archive of manuscripts, printed books and personal papers were deposited with
the [Biblioteca Palatina](/wiki/National\_Central\_Library\_\(Florence\)
"National Central Library \(Florence\)") in Florence, merging the collection
with the Biblioteca Magliabechiana in 1861.[253]
