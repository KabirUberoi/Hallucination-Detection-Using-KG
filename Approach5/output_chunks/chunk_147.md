Game theory has multiple applications in the field of AI/ML. It is often used
in developing autonomous systems that can make complex decisions in uncertain
environment.[143] Some other areas of application of game theory in AI/ML
context are as follows - multi-agent system formation, reinforcement
learning,[144] mechanism design etc.[145] By using game theory to model the
behavior of other agents and anticipate their actions, AI/ML systems can make
better decisions and operate more effectively.[146]
