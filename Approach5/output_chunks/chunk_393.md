(1745â€“1827)

During the 18th century, the mechanics founded by Newton was developed by
several scientists as more mathematicians learned calculus and elaborated upon
its initial formulation. The application of mathematical analysis to problems
of motion was known as rational mechanics, or mixed mathematics (and was later
termed [classical mechanics](/wiki/Classical\_mechanics "Classical
mechanics")).
