In addition to being an idea of considerable theoretical interest, string
theory provides a framework for constructing models of real-world physics that
combine general relativity and particle physics.
[Phenomenology](/wiki/Phenomenology\_\(particle\_physics\) "Phenomenology
\(particle physics\)") is the branch of theoretical physics in which
physicists construct realistic models of nature from more abstract theoretical
ideas. [String phenomenology](/wiki/String\_phenomenology "String
phenomenology") is the part of string theory that attempts to construct
realistic or semi-realistic models based on string theory.

Partly because of theoretical and mathematical difficulties and partly because
of the extremely high energies needed to test these theories experimentally,
there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point to any
of these models being a correct fundamental description of nature. This has
led some in the community to criticize these approaches to unification and
question the value of continued research on these problems.[12]
