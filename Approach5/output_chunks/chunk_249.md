showing Judge Holden

> The second in command, now left in charge of the camp, was a man of gigantic
> size who rejoiced in the name of Holden, called “Judge” Holden of Texas. Who
> or what he was no one knew but a cooler blooded villain never went unhung;
> he stood six feet six in his moccasins, had a large fleshy frame, a dull
> tallow colored face destitute of hair and all expression. But when a quarrel
> took place and blood shed, his hog-like eyes would gleam with a sullen
> ferocity worthy of the countenance of a fiend. His desires was blood and
> women, and terrible stories were circulated in camp of horrid crimes
> committed by him when bearing another name, in the Cherokee nation and
> Texas; and before we left Fronteras a little girl of ten years was found in
> the chapperal, foully violated and murdered. The mark of a huge hand on her
> little throat pointed him out as the ravisher as no other man had such a
> hand, but though all suspected, no one charged him with the crime.
>
> Holden was by far the best educated man in northern Mexico; he conversed
> with all in their own language, spoke in several Indian lingos, at a
> fandango would take the Harp or the Guitar from the hands of the musicians
> and charm all with his wonderful performance and out-waltz any poblana of
> the ball. He was “plum center” with a rifle or revolver, a daring horseman,
> acquainted with the nature of all the strange plants and their botanical
> names, great in geology and mineralogy, in short another Admirable Crichton
> [sc., the 16th-century Scottish prodigy and polymath], and with all an
> arrant coward.
>
> Not but that he possessed enough courage to fight Indians and Mexicans or
> anyone else where he had the advantage in strength, skill, and weapons. But
> where the combat would be equal, he would avoid it if possible. I hated him
> at first sight and he knew it, yet nothing could be more gentle and kind
> than his deportment towards me: He would often seek conversation with me and
> speak of Massachusetts and to my astonishment I found he knew more about
> Boston than I did.[5]

Some amateur historians have interpreted the name "Judge Holden" as a
pseudonym, and hoped to establish his true identity.[6] Popular candidates
include [Charles Wilkins Webber](/wiki/Charles\_Wilkins\_Webber "Charles Wilkins
Webber"), an educated man in the region who once used the pseudonym "Holden",
and [John Allen Veatch](/wiki/John\_Veatch "John Veatch"), a geologist who
operated in the region and who led a scalp-hunting party into Mexico.[7]
