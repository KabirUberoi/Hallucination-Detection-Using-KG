Bang Theory Theme" by [Barenaked Ladies](/wiki/Barenaked\_Ladies "Barenaked
Ladies") (2007)

The Canadian [alternative rock](/wiki/Alternative\_rock "Alternative rock")
band [Barenaked Ladies](/wiki/Barenaked\_Ladies "Barenaked Ladies") wrote and
recorded the show's theme song, which describes the history and formation of
the universe and the Earth. Co-lead singer [Ed Robertson](/wiki/Ed\_Robertson
"Ed Robertson") was asked by Lorre and Prady to write a theme song for the
show after the producers attended one of the band's concerts in Los Angeles.
Coincidentally, Robertson had recently read [Simon Singh](/wiki/Simon\_Singh
"Simon Singh")'s book \_[Big Bang](/wiki/Big\_Bang\_\(Singh\_book\) "Big Bang
\(Singh book\)")\_ ,[52][53] and at the concert he improvised a freestyle rap
about the origins of the universe.[\_[citation
needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\_] Lorre
and Prady phoned him shortly thereafter and asked him to write the theme song.
Having been asked to write songs for other films and shows, but ending up
being rejected because producers favored songs by other artists, Robertson
agreed to write the theme only after learning that Lorre and Prady had not
asked anyone else.[\_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed
"Wikipedia:Citation needed")\_]

On October 9, 2007, a full-length (1 minute and 45 seconds) version of the
song was released commercially.[54] Although some unofficial pages identify
the song title as "History of Everything,"[55] the cover art for the single
identifies the title as "Big Bang Theory Theme." A music video also was
released via special features on \_The Complete Fourth Season\_ DVD and Blu-ray
set.[56][57] The theme was included on the band's greatest hits album, \_[Hits
from Yesterday& the Day Before](/wiki/Hits\_from\_Yesterday\_%26\_the\_Day\_Before
"Hits from Yesterday & the Day Before")\_, released on September 27, 2011.[58]
In September 2015, [TMZ](/wiki/TMZ "TMZ") uncovered court documents showing
that [Steven Page](/wiki/Steven\_Page "Steven Page") sued[\_[needs
update](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Dates\_and\_numbers#Chronological\_items
"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")\_] former bandmate Robertson
over the song, alleging that he was promised 20 percent of the proceeds, but
that Robertson has kept that money for himself.[59]
