### Barkun's three
types[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Conspiracy\_theory&action=edit&section=8 "Edit
section: Barkun's three types")]

[Michael Barkun](/wiki/Michael\_Barkun "Michael Barkun") has identified three
classifications of conspiracy theory:[77]

 \* \_Event conspiracy theories\_. This refers to limited and well-defined events. Examples may include such conspiracies theories as those concerning the [Kennedy assassination](/wiki/Kennedy\_assassination\_conspiracies "Kennedy assassination conspiracies"), [9/11](/wiki/9/11 "9/11"), and the [spread of AIDS](/wiki/Discredited\_AIDS\_origins\_theories "Discredited AIDS origins theories").
 \* \_Systemic conspiracy theories\_. The conspiracy is believed to have broad goals, usually conceived as securing control of a country, a region, or even the entire world. The goals are sweeping, whilst the conspiratorial machinery is generally simple: a single, evil organization implements a plan to infiltrate and subvert existing institutions. This is a common scenario in conspiracy theories that focus on the alleged machinations of [Jews](/wiki/International\_Jewish\_conspiracy "International Jewish conspiracy"), [Freemasons](/wiki/Masonic\_conspiracy\_theories "Masonic conspiracy theories"), [Communism](/wiki/Red\_Scare "Red Scare"), or the [Catholic Church](/wiki/Vatican\_conspiracy\_theories "Vatican conspiracy theories").
 \* \_Superconspiracy theories\_. For Barkun, such theories link multiple alleged conspiracies together hierarchically. At the summit is a distant but all-powerful evil force. His cited examples are the ideas of [David Icke](/wiki/David\_Icke "David Icke") and [Milton William Cooper](/wiki/Milton\_William\_Cooper "Milton William Cooper").
