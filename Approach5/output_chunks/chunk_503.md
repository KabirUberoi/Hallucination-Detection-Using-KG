A biography by Galileo's pupil [Vincenzo Viviani](/wiki/Vincenzo\_Viviani
"Vincenzo Viviani") stated that Galileo had [dropped
balls](/wiki/Galileo%27s\_Leaning\_Tower\_of\_Pisa\_experiment "Galileo's Leaning
Tower of Pisa experiment") of the same material, but different
[masses](/wiki/Mass "Mass"), from the [Leaning Tower of
Pisa](/wiki/Leaning\_Tower\_of\_Pisa "Leaning Tower of Pisa") to demonstrate that
their time of descent was independent of their mass.[207] This was contrary to
what Aristotle had taught: that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones,
in direct proportion to weight.[208][209] While this story has been retold in
popular accounts, there is no account by Galileo himself of such an
experiment, and it is generally accepted by historians that it was at most a
[thought experiment](/wiki/Thought\_experiment "Thought experiment") which did
not actually take place.[210] An exception is Stillman Drake,[211] who argues
that the experiment did take place, more or less as Viviani described it.
However, most of Galileo's experiments with falling bodies were carried out
using inclined planes where both the issues of timing and [air
resistance](/wiki/Air\_resistance "Air resistance") were much reduced.[212]

During the [Apollo 15](/wiki/Apollo\_15 "Apollo 15") mission in 1971, astronaut
[David Scott](/wiki/David\_Scott "David Scott") showed that Galileo was right:
acceleration is the same for all bodies subject to gravity on the Moon, even
for a hammer and a feather.
