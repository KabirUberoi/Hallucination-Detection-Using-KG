Since the superstring revolutions of the 1980s and 1990s, string theory has
been one of the dominant paradigms of high energy theoretical physics.[132]
Some string theorists have expressed the view that there does not exist an
equally successful alternative theory addressing the deep questions of
fundamental physics. In an interview from 1987, [Nobel
laureate](/wiki/Nobel\_laureate "Nobel laureate") [David
Gross](/wiki/David\_Gross "David Gross") made the following controversial
comments about the reasons for the popularity of string theory:

> The most important [reason] is that there are no other good ideas around.
> That's what gets most people into it. When people started to get interested
> in string theory they didn't know anything about it. In fact, the first
> reaction of most people is that the theory is extremely ugly and unpleasant,
> at least that was the case a few years ago when the understanding of string
> theory was much less developed. It was difficult for people to learn about
> it and to be turned on. So I think the real reason why people have got
> attracted by it is because there is no other game in town. All other
> approaches of constructing grand unified theories, which were more
> conservative to begin with, and only gradually became more and more radical,
> have failed, and this game hasn't failed yet.[133]

Several other high-profile theorists and commentators have expressed similar
views, suggesting that there are no viable alternatives to string theory.[134]

Many critics of string theory have commented on this state of affairs. In his
book criticizing string theory, Peter Woit views the status of string theory
research as unhealthy and detrimental to the future of fundamental physics. He
argues that the extreme popularity of string theory among theoretical
physicists is partly a consequence of the financial structure of academia and
the fierce competition for scarce resources.[135] In his book \_[The Road to
Reality](/wiki/The\_Road\_to\_Reality "The Road to Reality")\_ , mathematical
physicist [Roger Penrose](/wiki/Roger\_Penrose "Roger Penrose") expresses
similar views, stating "The often frantic competitiveness that this ease of
communication engenders leads to [bandwagon effects](/wiki/Bandwagon\_effect
"Bandwagon effect"), where researchers fear to be left behind if they do not
join in."[136] Penrose also claims that the technical difficulty of modern
physics forces young scientists to rely on the preferences of established
researchers, rather than forging new paths of their own.[137] Lee Smolin
expresses a slightly different position in his critique, claiming that string
theory grew out of a tradition of particle physics which discourages
speculation about the foundations of physics, while his preferred approach,
[loop quantum gravity](/wiki/Loop\_quantum\_gravity "Loop quantum gravity"),
encourages more radical thinking. According to Smolin,

> String theory is a powerful, well-motivated idea and deserves much of the
> work that has been devoted to it. If it has so far failed, the principal
> reason is that its intrinsic flaws are closely tied to its strengthsâ€”and, of
> course, the story is unfinished, since string theory may well turn out to be
> part of the truth. The real question is not why we have expended so much
> energy on string theory but why we haven't expended nearly enough on
> alternative approaches.[138]

Smolin goes on to offer a number of prescriptions for how scientists might
encourage a greater diversity of approaches to quantum gravity research.[139]
