Galileo conducted several experiments with [pendulums](/wiki/Pendulum
"Pendulum"). It is popularly believed (thanks to the biography by [Vincenzo
Viviani](/wiki/Vincenzo\_Viviani "Vincenzo Viviani")) that these began by
watching the swings of the bronze chandelier in the cathedral of Pisa, using
his pulse as a timer. The first recorded interest in pendulums made by Galileo
were in his posthumously published notes titled \_[On
Motion](/wiki/De\_motu\_antiquiora "De motu antiquiora")\_ ,[195] but later
experiments are described in his \_Two New Sciences\_. Galileo claimed that a
simple pendulum is [isochronous](/wiki/Pendulum#Period\_of\_oscillation
"Pendulum"), i.e. that its swings always take the same amount of time,
independently of the [amplitude](/wiki/Amplitude "Amplitude"). In fact, this
is only approximately true,[196] as was discovered by [Christiaan
Huygens](/wiki/Christiaan\_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens"). Galileo also found
that the square of the period varies directly with the length of the pendulum.
