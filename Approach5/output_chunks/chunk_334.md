### Eight
interpretations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Quantum\_Reality&action=edit&section=3
"Edit section: Eight interpretations")]

Herbert identifies eight [interpretations of quantum
mechanics](/wiki/Interpretations\_of\_quantum\_mechanics "Interpretations of
quantum mechanics"), all consistent with observation and with the
aforementioned mathematical formalisms. He likens these different
interpretations to the story of the [blind men and an
elephant](/wiki/Blind\_men\_and\_an\_elephant "Blind men and an
elephant")—different approaches to the same underlying reality, which yield
remarkably different (but often overlapping) pictures. The interpretations
identified by Herbert are:

 1. The \*\*[Copenhagen interpretation](/wiki/Copenhagen\_interpretation "Copenhagen interpretation"), Part I ("There is no deep reality.")\*\* Most notably associated with [Niels Bohr](/wiki/Niels\_Bohr "Niels Bohr") and [Werner Heisenberg](/wiki/Werner\_Heisenberg "Werner Heisenberg"), Herbert identifies this as the most broadly accepted interpretation among physicists. In this interpretation, dynamic attributes do not describe the reality of quantum objects themselves, but inhere instead in the \_[relationship](/wiki/Relationalism "Relationalism")\_ between the observed object and the measurement device.[2]: 158–164
 2. The \*\*Copenhagen interpretation, Part II ("Reality is created by observation.")\*\* In this variation of the Copenhagen interpretation, associated with [John Archibald Wheeler](/wiki/John\_Archibald\_Wheeler "John Archibald Wheeler"), the reality of quantum attributes is created in the act of [observation](/wiki/Observation "Observation"), as illustrated by the example of [Wheeler's delayed choice experiment](/wiki/Wheeler%27s\_delayed\_choice\_experiment "Wheeler's delayed choice experiment").[2]: 164–168
 3. \*\*"Reality is an undivided wholeness."\*\* This interpretation, associated with [David Bohm](/wiki/David\_Bohm "David Bohm") and [Walter Heitler](/wiki/Walter\_Heitler "Walter Heitler"), suggests that the state of the entire universe may be implicated in any quantum measurement. Herbert highlights the apparent interaction of widely separated [entangled](/wiki/Quantum\_entanglement "Quantum entanglement") particles, which may be represented by a single combined wave function, or "shared reality", in a high-dimensional [configuration space](/wiki/Configuration\_space\_\(physics\) "Configuration space \(physics\)").[2]: 168–172
 4. The \*\*[many-worlds interpretation](/wiki/Many-worlds\_interpretation "Many-worlds interpretation")\*\*. Devised by [Hugh Everett](/wiki/Hugh\_Everett "Hugh Everett"), this interpretation does away with the conceptual problem of [wave function collapse](/wiki/Wave\_function\_collapse "Wave function collapse") by supposing that all possible outcomes occur equally, in a constantly branching tree of parallel universes.[2]: 172–175
 5. \*\*[Quantum logic](/wiki/Quantum\_logic "Quantum logic") ("The world obeys a non-human kind of reasoning.")\*\* Associated with [John von Neumann](/wiki/John\_von\_Neumann "John von Neumann"), [Garrett Birkhoff](/wiki/Garrett\_Birkhoff "Garrett Birkhoff"), and [David Finkelstein](/wiki/David\_Finkelstein "David Finkelstein"), this interpretation holds that quantum objects \_do\_ possess innate attributes, but that the relationships between these attributes are governed by a non-[distributive lattice](/wiki/Distributive\_lattice "Distributive lattice"), or "wave logic", unlike the [Boolean lattice](/wiki/Boolean\_algebra\_\(structure\) "Boolean algebra \(structure\)") governing classical objects. In the example of the "three-[polarizer](/wiki/Polarizer "Polarizer") paradox", two stacked, orthogonally-oriented polarizers will not allow any light to pass through (the [meet](/wiki/Join\_and\_meet "Join and meet") of the sets of photons which will pass through each filter is [null](/wiki/Null\_set "Null set")), yet the insertion of a diagonally-oriented polarizer between them allows some light to pass through the stack. The paradox can be understood by considering a polarized beam as a [superposition](/wiki/Quantum\_superposition "Quantum superposition"), with diagonal components that [interfere](/wiki/Interference\_\(wave\_propagation\) "Interference \(wave propagation\)") destructively.[2]: 177–185
 6. \*\*[Neorealism](/wiki/De\_Broglie%E2%80%93Bohm\_theory "De Broglie–Bohm theory") ("The world is made of ordinary objects.")\*\* Constructed by [David Bohm](/wiki/David\_Bohm "David Bohm") and also associated with [Louis de Broglie](/wiki/Louis\_de\_Broglie "Louis de Broglie"), this interpretation holds that quantum objects possess definite attributes, but that these attributes can change value instantly in response to events anywhere in the universe, with this information encoded in a physical [pilot wave](/wiki/Pilot\_wave "Pilot wave") which must be able to travel [faster than light](/wiki/Superluminal\_communication "Superluminal communication"). Other physicists attempted to construct object-based models which did away with this superluminal communication, but [Bell's theorem](/wiki/Bell%27s\_theorem "Bell's theorem") later proved this to be impossible. For this reason, according to Herbert, neorealism is rejected by most of the physics establishment.[2]: 185–189
 7. \*\*"[Consciousness creates reality](/wiki/Von\_Neumann%E2%80%93Wigner\_interpretation "Von Neumann–Wigner interpretation")."\*\* First proposed by [John von Neumann](/wiki/John\_von\_Neumann "John von Neumann"), this interpretation grants special status to [conscious](/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness") minds as the location of [wave function collapse](/wiki/Wave\_function\_collapse "Wave function collapse"), in which the myriad possibilities of a quantum system are narrowed to one observed state. Unlike the Copenhagen interpretation, in which the observer selects which attribute will be seen to have a definite value but does not determine the value itself, von Neumann contended that the actual attribute value is determined in a collapse that occurs at the interface of the brain and the mind.[2]: 189–193
 8. \*\*"The duplex world of[Werner Heisenberg](/wiki/Werner\_Heisenberg "Werner Heisenberg")."\*\* Heisenberg recognized a division inherent in the Copenhagen interpretation, between the concrete actuality ([phenomenon](/wiki/Phenomenon "Phenomenon")) of observations and the range of potentiality ([noumenon](/wiki/Noumenon "Noumenon")) described by the wave function. In seeking to address the ontological nature of the unobserved world, he considered quantum theory to be not merely a successful mathematical analogy, but a literal description of the underlying reality. In Herbert's description of Heisenberg's view, the unobserved world is a world composed of possibility, qualitatively less real than the world of observed fact.[2]: 193–195
