A symmetric game is a game where each player earns the same payoff when making
the same choice. In other words, the identity of the player does not change
the resulting game facing the other player.[20] Many of the commonly studied
2Ã—2 games are symmetric. The standard representations of
[chicken](/wiki/Game\_of\_chicken "Game of chicken"), the prisoner's dilemma,
and the [stag hunt](/wiki/Stag\_hunt "Stag hunt") are all symmetric games.

The most commonly studied asymmetric games are games where there are not
identical strategy sets for both players. For instance, the [ultimatum
game](/wiki/Ultimatum\_game "Ultimatum game") and similarly the [dictator
game](/wiki/Dictator\_game "Dictator game") have different strategies for each
player. It is possible, however, for a game to have identical strategies for
both players, yet be asymmetric. For example, the game pictured in this
section's graphic is asymmetric despite having identical strategy sets for
both players.
