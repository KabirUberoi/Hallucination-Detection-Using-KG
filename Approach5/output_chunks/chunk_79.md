## Black holes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=String\_theory&action=edit&section=10
"Edit section: Black holes")]

In general relativity, a black hole is defined as a region of spacetime in
which the gravitational field is so strong that no particle or radiation can
escape. In the currently accepted models of stellar evolution, black holes are
thought to arise when massive stars undergo [gravitational
collapse](/wiki/Gravitational\_collapse "Gravitational collapse"), and many
[galaxies](/wiki/Galaxies "Galaxies") are thought to contain [supermassive
black holes](/wiki/Supermassive\_black\_hole "Supermassive black hole") at their
centers. Black holes are also important for theoretical reasons, as they
present profound challenges for theorists attempting to understand the quantum
aspects of gravity. String theory has proved to be an important tool for
investigating the theoretical properties of black holes because it provides a
framework in which theorists can study their
[thermodynamics](/wiki/Black\_hole\_thermodynamics "Black hole
thermodynamics").[53]
