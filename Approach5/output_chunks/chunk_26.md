 1. \*\*^\*\* See for example [Hippocrates](/wiki/Hippocrates "Hippocrates") [Praeceptiones, Part 1](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0251:text=Praec.:section=1&highlight=medical%2Ctheory).

 2. \*\*^\*\* The word \_theoria\_ occurs in [Greek philosophy](/wiki/Ancient\_Greek\_philosophy "Ancient Greek philosophy"), for example, that of [Plato](/wiki/Plato "Plato"). It is a statement of how and why particular facts are related. It is related to words for θεωρός "spectator", θέα \_thea\_ "a view" + ὁρᾶν \_horan\_ "to see", literally "looking at a show". See for example dictionary entries at Perseus website.
 3. \*\*^\*\* The [LSJ](/wiki/A\_Greek%E2%80%93English\_Lexicon "A Greek–English Lexicon") cites two passages of Aristotle as examples, both from the \_[Metaphysics](/wiki/Metaphysics\_\(Aristotle\) "Metaphysics \(Aristotle\)")\_ and involving the definition of [natural science](/wiki/Natural\_science "Natural science"): [11.1064a17](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D11%3Asection%3D1064a), "it is clear that natural science (φυσικὴν ἐπιστήμην) must be neither practical (πρακτικὴν) nor productive (ποιητικὴν), but speculative (θεωρητικὴν)" and [6.1025b25](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D6%3Asection%3D1025b), "Thus if every intellectual activity [διάνοια] is either practical or productive or speculative (θεωρητική), physics (φυσικὴ) will be a speculative [θεωρητική] science." So Aristotle actually made a three way distinction between practical, theoretical and productive or technical—or between doing, contemplating or making. All three types involve thinking, but are distinguished by what causes the objects of thought to move or change.
