In his essay "Gravers False and True: \_Blood Meridian\_ as
[Gnostic](/wiki/Gnosticism "Gnosticism") Tragedy", literature professor [Leo
Daugherty](/w/index.php?title=Leo\_Daugherty&action=edit&redlink=1 "Leo
Daugherty \(page does not exist\)") argued that McCarthy's Holden is--or at
least embodies--a gnostic [archon](/wiki/Archon\_\(Gnosticism\) "Archon
\(Gnosticism\)") (a kind of [demon](/wiki/Demon "Demon")).[13] [Harold
Bloom](/wiki/Harold\_Bloom "Harold Bloom"), who declared Judge Holden to be
"the most frightening figure in all of [American
literature](/wiki/American\_literature "American literature")",[14] even came
to regard him as immortal.[15] However, unlike Daugherty, Bloom argues that
Holden defies identification as being under any "system" such as Gnosticism,
citing the passage in the book stating that there was no "system by which to
divide [him] back into his origins".[16] Rather, Bloom "resort[s]" to literary
comparison with [William Shakespeare](/wiki/William\_Shakespeare "William
Shakespeare")'s [Iago](/wiki/Iago "Iago"), a methodical dispenser of
strife.[17]
