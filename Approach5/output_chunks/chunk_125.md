Evolutionary game theory studies players who adjust their strategies over time
according to rules that are not necessarily rational or farsighted.[39] In
general, the evolution of strategies over time according to such rules is
modeled as a [Markov chain](/wiki/Markov\_chain "Markov chain") with a state
variable such as the current strategy profile or how the game has been played
in the recent past. Such rules may feature imitation, optimization, or
survival of the fittest.

In biology, such models can represent [evolution](/wiki/Evolution
"Evolution"), in which offspring adopt their parents' strategies and parents
who play more successful strategies (i.e. corresponding to higher payoffs)
have a greater number of offspring. In the social sciences, such models
typically represent strategic adjustment by players who play a game many times
within their lifetime and, consciously or unconsciously, occasionally adjust
their strategies.[40]
