"Edit section: Reception")]

Critical reception has been generally positive.[1][2][3][4] \_[The New York
Times](/wiki/The\_New\_York\_Times "The New York Times")\_ wrote a mixed review
for \_The Fabric of Reality\_ , writing that it "is full of refreshingly
oblique, provocative insights. But I came away from it with only the mushiest
sense of how the strands in Deutsch's tapestry hang together."[5] \_[The
Guardian](/wiki/The\_Guardian "The Guardian")\_ was more favorable in their
review, stating "This is a deep and ambitious book and there were plenty of
moments when I was out of my depth (the Platonic dialogue between Deutsch and
a Crypto-inductivist left me with a pronounced sinking feeling). But the sheer
adventure of thinking not just out of the envelope but right out of the
Newtonian universe is exhilarating."[6]
