domains of physics

While physics itself aims to discover universal laws, its theories lie in
explicit domains of applicability.

Conference](/wiki/Solvay\_Conference "Solvay Conference") of 1927, with
prominent physicists such as [Albert Einstein](/wiki/Albert\_Einstein "Albert
Einstein"), [Werner Heisenberg](/wiki/Werner\_Heisenberg "Werner Heisenberg"),
[Max Planck](/wiki/Max\_Planck "Max Planck"), [Hendrik
Lorentz](/wiki/Hendrik\_Lorentz "Hendrik Lorentz"), [Niels
Bohr](/wiki/Niels\_Bohr "Niels Bohr"), [Marie Curie](/wiki/Marie\_Curie "Marie
Curie"), [Erwin Schrödinger](/wiki/Erwin\_Schr%C3%B6dinger "Erwin Schrödinger")
and [Paul Dirac](/wiki/Paul\_Dirac "Paul Dirac")

Loosely speaking, the laws of classical physics accurately describe systems
whose important length scales are greater than the atomic scale and whose
motions are much slower than the speed of light. Outside of this domain,
observations do not match predictions provided by classical mechanics.
Einstein contributed the framework of special relativity, which replaced
notions of [absolute time and space](/wiki/Absolute\_time\_and\_space "Absolute
time and space") with [spacetime](/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") and allowed an
accurate description of systems whose components have speeds approaching the
speed of light. Planck, Schrödinger, and others introduced quantum mechanics,
a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions that allowed an accurate
description of atomic and subatomic scales. Later, [quantum field
theory](/wiki/Quantum\_field\_theory "Quantum field theory") unified quantum
mechanics and special relativity. General relativity allowed for a dynamical,
curved spacetime, with which highly massive systems and the large-scale
structure of the universe can be well-described. General relativity has not
yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions; several candidate
theories of [quantum gravity](/wiki/Quantum\_gravity "Quantum gravity") are
being developed.
