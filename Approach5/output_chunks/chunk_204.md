"Edit section: Fusion paranoia")]

[Michael Kelly](/wiki/Michael\_Kelly\_\(editor\) "Michael Kelly \(editor\)"), a
\_[Washington Post](/wiki/The\_Washington\_Post "The Washington Post")\_
journalist and critic of [anti-war](/wiki/Anti-war "Anti-war") movements on
both the left and right, coined the term "fusion paranoia" to refer to a
political convergence of left-wing and right-wing activists around anti-war
issues and [civil liberties](/wiki/Civil\_liberties "Civil liberties"), which
he said were motivated by a shared belief in conspiracism or shared [anti-
government](/wiki/Anti-statism "Anti-statism") views.[144]

Barkun has adopted this term to refer to how the synthesis of paranoid
conspiracy theories, which were once limited to American fringe audiences, has
given them mass appeal and enabled them to become commonplace in [mass
media](/wiki/Mass\_media "Mass media"),[145] thereby inaugurating an unrivaled
period of people actively preparing for [apocalyptic](/wiki/Apocalypticism
"Apocalypticism") or [millenarian](/wiki/Millenarianism "Millenarianism")
scenarios in the United States of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.[146]
Barkun notes the occurrence of lone-wolf conflicts with law enforcement acting
as proxy for threatening the established political powers.[147]
