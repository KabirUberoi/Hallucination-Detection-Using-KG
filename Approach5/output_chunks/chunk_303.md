sacrificing himself upon Yggdrasil (1895) by [Lorenz
Frølich](/wiki/Lorenz\_Fr%C3%B8lich "Lorenz Frølich")

In stanza 138 of the poem \_[Hávamál](/wiki/H%C3%A1vam%C3%A1l "Hávamál")\_ ,
Odin describes how he once sacrificed himself to himself by hanging on a tree.
The stanza reads:

> I know that I hung on a windy tree 
> [nine](/wiki/Numbers\_in\_Norse\_mythology "Numbers in Norse mythology") long
> nights, 
> wounded with a spear, dedicated to Odin, 
> myself to myself, 
> on that tree of which no man knows 
> from where its roots run.[7]

In the stanza that follows, Odin describes how he had no food nor drink there,
that he peered downward, and that "I took up the [runes](/wiki/Runes "Runes"),
screaming I took them, then I fell back from there."[7] Odin later used "the
knowledge of the sacred runes" as a magical tool to give to mankind to
increase humans' skill in magic and poetry.[8]

While Yggdrasil is not mentioned by name in the poem and other trees exist in
Norse mythology, the tree is near universally accepted as Yggdrasil by
scholars, and if the tree is Yggdrasil, then the name \_Yggdrasil\_ directly
relates to this story.[9]
