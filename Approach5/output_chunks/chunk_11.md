### Intertheoretic reduction and
elimination[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Theory&action=edit&section=4 "Edit

If a new theory better explains and predicts a phenomenon than an old theory
(i.e., it has more [explanatory power](/wiki/Explanatory\_power "Explanatory
power")), we are [justified](/wiki/Theory\_of\_justification "Theory of
justification") in believing that the newer theory describes reality more
correctly. This is called an \_intertheoretic reduction\_ because the terms of
the old theory can be reduced to the terms of the new one. For instance, our
historical understanding about \_sound\_ , \_light\_ and \_heat\_ have been reduced
to \_wave compressions and rarefactions\_ , \_electromagnetic waves\_ , and
\_molecular kinetic energy\_ , respectively. These terms, which are identified
with each other, are called \_intertheoretic identities.\_ When an old and new
theory are parallel in this way, we can conclude that the new one describes
the same reality, only more completely.

When a new theory uses new terms that do not reduce to terms of an older
theory, but rather replace them because they misrepresent reality, it is
called an \_intertheoretic elimination.\_ For instance, the [obsolete scientific
theory](/wiki/Superseded\_scientific\_theories "Superseded scientific theories")
that put forward an understanding of heat transfer in terms of the movement of
[caloric fluid](/wiki/Caloric\_fluid "Caloric fluid") was eliminated when a
theory of heat as energy replaced it. Also, the theory that
[phlogiston](/wiki/Phlogiston "Phlogiston") is a substance released from
burning and rusting material was eliminated with the new understanding of the
reactivity of oxygen.
