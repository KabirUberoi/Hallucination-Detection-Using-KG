%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%GROUND_TRUTH%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Ground Truth : 

Pattern is Movement (often stylized as Pattern is Movement) is an American indie rock band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that was established in 2001.
They have been categorized by some reviewers as a math rock group and compared to groups such as Don Caballero, Sunny Day Real Estate, and Pinback.
However, as the band moved from a five-piece to a two-piece, their sound moved away from the angular sound of previous records and closer to a more melodic heavy composition structure with sing-a-long choruses.
The current two-piece sound can be attributed to influences such as Dirty Projectors, Beirut, and Grizzly Bear.
In an interview with Baeble Music, Ward coined the band with the term "indie cabaret".
In 2006, producer and engineer Scott Solter (who has worked with John Vanderslice and The Mountain Goats) remixed the 2005 album Stowaway, which he had also recorded.

Since 2008, Pattern is Movement have been performing as a two-piece.
On the January 2008 issue of Philadelphia Weekly, they were featured in a cover story citing "four indie bands that can expect a big year".
The band emerged with a new album, All Together, documenting the lineup in the spring of 2008, also recorded with Solter.
