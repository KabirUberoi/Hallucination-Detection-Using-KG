According to the preface of the first edition, reprinted in subsequent
editions, Capra struggled to reconcile [theoretical
physics](/wiki/Theoretical\_physics "Theoretical physics") and [Eastern
mysticism](/wiki/Eastern\_mysticism "Eastern mysticism") and was at first
"helped on my way by 'power plants'" or [psychedelics](/wiki/Psychedelics
"Psychedelics"), with the first experience "so overwhelming that I burst into
tears, at the same time, not unlike [Castaneda](/wiki/Carlos\_Castaneda "Carlos
Castaneda"), pouring out my impressions to a piece of paper". (p. 12, 4th ed.)

Capra later discussed his ideas with [Werner
Heisenberg](/wiki/Werner\_Heisenberg "Werner Heisenberg") in 1972, as he
mentioned in the following interview excerpt:

> I had several discussions with Heisenberg. I lived in England then [circa
> 1972], and I visited him several times in Munich and showed him the whole
> manuscript chapter by chapter. He was very interested and very open, and he
> told me something that I think is not known publicly because he never
> published it. He said that he was well aware of these parallels. While he
> was working on quantum theory he went to India to lecture and was a guest of
> [Tagore](/wiki/Rabindranath\_Tagore "Rabindranath Tagore"). He talked a lot
> with Tagore about Indian philosophy. Heisenberg told me that these talks had
> helped him a lot with his work in physics, because they showed him that all
> these new ideas in quantum physics were in fact not all that crazy. He
> realized there was, in fact, a whole culture that subscribed to very similar
> ideas. Heisenberg said that this was a great help for him. [Niels
> Bohr](/wiki/Niels\_Bohr "Niels Bohr") had a similar experience when he went
> to China.[1]

Bohr adopted the [yin yang](/wiki/Yin\_yang "Yin yang") symbol as part of his
[coat of arms](/wiki/Coat\_of\_arms "Coat of arms") when he was
[knighted](/wiki/Knight "Knight") in 1947,[2] it is claimed in the book that
it was a result of orientalist influences.

\_The Tao of Physics\_ was followed by other books of the same genre like \_The
Hidden Connection\_ , \_[The Turning Point](/wiki/The\_Turning\_Point\_\(book\)
"The Turning Point \(book\)")\_ and \_The Web of Life\_ in which Capra extended
the argument of how [Eastern mysticism](/wiki/Eastern\_mysticism "Eastern
mysticism") and scientific findings of today relate, and how Eastern mysticism
might also have the linguistic and philosophical tools required to undertake
to some of the biggest scientific challenges remaining.
