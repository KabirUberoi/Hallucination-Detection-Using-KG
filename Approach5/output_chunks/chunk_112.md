### Mathematical
origins[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Game\_theory&action=edit&section=3 "Edit
section: Mathematical origins")]

Discussions on the mathematics of games began long before the rise of modern
mathematical game theory. [Cardano](/wiki/Gerolamo\_Cardano "Gerolamo
Cardano")'s work \_Liber de ludo aleae\_ (\_Book on Games of Chance\_), which was
written around 1564 but published posthumously in 1663, sketches some basic
ideas on games of chance. In the 1650s, [Pascal](/wiki/Blaise\_Pascal "Blaise
Pascal") and [Huygens](/wiki/Christiaan\_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens")
developed the concept of [expectation](/wiki/Expected\_value "Expected value")
on reasoning about the structure of games of chance. Pascal argued for equal
division when chances are equal while Huygens extended the argument by
considering strategies for a player who can make any bet with any opponent so
long as its terms are equal.[7] Huygens later published his gambling calculus
as \_De ratiociniis in ludo aleæ\_ (\_On Reasoning in Games of Chance\_) in 1657.

In 1713, a letter attributed to Charles Waldegrave, an active
[Jacobite](/wiki/Jacobitism "Jacobitism") and uncle to British diplomat [James
Waldegrave](/wiki/James\_Waldegrave,\_1st\_Earl\_Waldegrave "James Waldegrave, 1st
Earl Waldegrave"), analyzed a game called "[le her](/wiki/Le\_her "Le
her")".[8][9] Waldegrave provided a [minimax](/wiki/Minimax "Minimax") [mixed
strategy](/wiki/Mixed\_strategy "Mixed strategy") solution to a two-person
version of the card game, and the problem is now known as [Waldegrave
problem](/wiki/Waldegrave\_problem "Waldegrave problem"). In 1838, [Antoine
Augustin Cournot](/wiki/Antoine\_Augustin\_Cournot "Antoine Augustin Cournot")
considered a [duopoly](/wiki/Duopoly "Duopoly") and presented a solution that
is the [Nash equilibrium](/wiki/Nash\_equilibrium "Nash equilibrium") of the
game in his \_Recherches sur les principes mathématiques de la théorie des
richesses\_ (\_Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of
Wealth\_).

In 1913, [Ernst Zermelo](/wiki/Ernst\_Zermelo "Ernst Zermelo") published \_Über
eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels\_ (\_On an
Application of Set Theory to the Theory of the Game of Chess\_), which proved
that the optimal chess strategy is [strictly
determined](/wiki/Strictly\_determined\_game "Strictly determined game"). This
paved the way for more general theorems.[10]

In 1938, the Danish mathematical economist [Frederik
Zeuthen](/wiki/Frederik\_Zeuthen "Frederik Zeuthen") proved that the
mathematical model had a winning strategy by using [Brouwer's fixed point
theorem](/wiki/Brouwer\_fixed\_point\_theorem "Brouwer fixed point theorem").[11]
In his 1938 book \_Applications aux Jeux de Hasard\_ and earlier notes, [Émile
Borel](/wiki/%C3%89mile\_Borel "Émile Borel") proved a minimax theorem for two-
person zero-sum matrix games only when the pay-off matrix is symmetric and
provided a solution to a non-trivial infinite game (known in English as
[Blotto game](/wiki/Blotto\_game "Blotto game")). Borel conjectured the non-
existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in [finite two-person zero-sum
games](/wiki/Finite\_Game "Finite Game"), a conjecture that was proved false by
von Neumann.
