display at the [Griffith Observatory](/wiki/Griffith\_Observatory "Griffith
Observatory")

Using his [refracting telescope](/wiki/Refracting\_telescope "Refracting
telescope"), Galileo observed in late 1609 that the surface of the Moon is not
smooth.[36] Early the next year, he observed the four largest moons of
Jupiter.[51] Later in 1610, he observed the phases of Venus—a proof of
heliocentrism—as well as Saturn, though he thought the planet's rings were two
other planets.[66] In 1612, he observed Neptune and noted its motion, but did
not identify it as a planet.[68]

Galileo made studies of sunspots,[69] the Milky Way, and made various
observations about stars, including how to measure their apparent size without
a telescope.[78][79][80]

He coined the term [Aurora Borealis](/wiki/Aurora\_Borealis "Aurora Borealis")
in 1619 from the Roman goddess of the dawn and the Greek name for the north
wind, to describe lights in the northern and southern sky when particles from
the solar wind energise the magnetosphere.[181]
