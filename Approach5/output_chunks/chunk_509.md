The Galileo affair was largely forgotten after Galileo's death, and the
controversy subsided. The Inquisition's ban on reprinting Galileo's works was
lifted in 1718 when permission was granted to publish an edition of his works
(excluding the condemned \_Dialogue\_) in Florence.[223] In 1741, [Pope Benedict
XIV](/wiki/Pope\_Benedict\_XIV "Pope Benedict XIV") authorised the publication
of an edition of Galileo's complete scientific works[224] which included a
mildly censored version of the \_Dialogue\_.[225][224] In 1758, the general
prohibition against works advocating heliocentrism was removed from the [Index
of prohibited books](/wiki/Index\_Librorum\_Prohibitorum "Index Librorum
Prohibitorum"), although the specific ban on uncensored versions of the
\_Dialogue\_ and Copernicus's \_De Revolutionibus\_ remained.[226][224] All traces
of official opposition to heliocentrism by the church disappeared in 1835 when
these works were finally dropped from the Index.[227][228]

Interest in the Galileo affair was revived in the early 19th century when
Protestant polemicists used it (and other events such as the [Spanish
Inquisition](/wiki/Spanish\_Inquisition "Spanish Inquisition") and the [myth of
the flat Earth](/wiki/Myth\_of\_the\_flat\_Earth "Myth of the flat Earth")) to
attack Roman Catholicism.[9] Interest in it has waxed and waned ever since. In
1939, [Pope Pius XII](/wiki/Pope\_Pius\_XII "Pope Pius XII"), in his first
speech to the [Pontifical Academy of
Sciences](/wiki/Pontifical\_Academy\_of\_Sciences "Pontifical Academy of
Sciences"), within a few months of his election to the papacy, described
Galileo as being among the "most audacious heroes of research... not afraid of
the stumbling blocks and the risks on the way, nor fearful of the funereal
monuments".[229] His close advisor of 40 years, Professor Robert Leiber,
wrote: "Pius XII was very careful not to close any doors (to science)
prematurely. He was energetic on this point and regretted that in the case of
Galileo."[230]

On 15 February 1990, in a speech delivered at the [Sapienza University of
Rome](/wiki/Sapienza\_University\_of\_Rome "Sapienza University of
Rome"),[231][232] Cardinal Ratzinger (later [Pope Benedict
XVI](/wiki/Pope\_Benedict\_XVI "Pope Benedict XVI")) cited some current views on
the Galileo affair as forming what he called "a symptomatic case that permits
us to see how deep the self-doubt of the modern age, of science and technology
goes today".[233] Some of the views he cited were those of the philosopher
[Paul Feyerabend](/wiki/Paul\_Feyerabend "Paul Feyerabend"), whom he quoted as
saying: "The Church at the time of Galileo kept much more closely to reason
than did Galileo himself, and it took into consideration the ethical and
social consequences of Galileo's teaching too. Its verdict against Galileo was
rational and just and the revision of this verdict can be justified only on
the grounds of what is politically opportune."[233] The Cardinal did not
clearly indicate whether he agreed or disagreed with Feyerabend's assertions.
He did, however, say: "It would be foolish to construct an impulsive
apologetic on the basis of such views."[233]

On 31 October 1992, [Pope John Paul II](/wiki/Pope\_John\_Paul\_II "Pope John
Paul II") acknowledged that the Inquisition had erred in condemning Galileo
for asserting that the Earth revolves around the Sun. "John Paul said the
theologians who condemned Galileo did not recognize the formal distinction
between the Bible and its interpretation."[234]

In March 2008, the head of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, [Nicola
Cabibbo](/wiki/Nicola\_Cabibbo "Nicola Cabibbo"), announced a plan to honour
Galileo by erecting a statue of him inside the Vatican walls.[235] In December
of the same year, during events to mark the 400th anniversary of Galileo's
earliest telescopic observations, Pope Benedict XVI praised his contributions
to astronomy.[236] A month later, however, the head of the Pontifical Council
for Culture, Gianfranco Ravasi, revealed that the plan to erect a statue of
Galileo on the grounds of the Vatican had been suspended.[237]
