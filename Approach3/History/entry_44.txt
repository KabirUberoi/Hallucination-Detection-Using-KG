Ground Truth : 

Rudolfo Austria "Rudy" Fernandez, Sr. (July 26, 1927 - June 9, 1979) was a prominent Filipino labor leader, trade unionist, and staunch opponent of the late President Ferdinand Marcos in Davao City, Philippines.
He was one of the original organizers of the Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP KMP) in 1975 and helped draft, develop, and establish its constitution and by-laws.
He first came into the Philippine labor movement arena when he founded the Davao Port General Transport Worker's Union (DPGTWU), now the Association of Trade Unions - TUCP (ATU-TUCP), in Davao City.
DPGTWU was one of the most active labor organizations in Davao City and its membership spread throughout Mindanao in the southern Philippines during the years between 1967-1979.
He ran for the Interim Batasang Pambansa (IBP) in the Philippines in 1978 as an industrial labor sectoral representative for the Mindanao region but ultimately lost against his closest rival, Princess Porti Pacasum, daughter of one of the richest Lanao Muslim clans and owner of the biggest transport company in Lanao, Philippines.
