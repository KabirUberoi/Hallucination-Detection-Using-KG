Some historians have argued that [psychological
projection](/wiki/Psychological\_projection "Psychological projection") is
prevalent amongst conspiracy theorists. This projection, according to the
argument, is manifested in the form of attribution of undesirable
characteristics of the self to the conspirators. Historian Richard Hofstadter
stated that:

> This enemy seems on many counts a projection of the self; both the ideal and
> the unacceptable aspects of the self are attributed to him. A fundamental
> paradox of the paranoid style is the imitation of the enemy. The enemy, for
> example, may be the cosmopolitan intellectual, but the paranoid will outdo
> him in the apparatus of scholarship, even of pedantry. ... The Ku Klux Klan
> imitated Catholicism to the point of donning priestly vestments, developing
> an elaborate ritual and an equally elaborate hierarchy. The [John Birch
> Society](/wiki/John\_Birch\_Society "John Birch Society") emulates Communist
> cells and quasi-secret operation through "front" groups, and preaches a
> ruthless prosecution of the ideological war along lines very similar to
> those it finds in the Communist enemy. Spokesmen of the various
> fundamentalist anti-Communist "crusades" openly express their admiration for
> the dedication, discipline, and strategic ingenuity the Communist cause
> calls forth.[127]

Hofstadter also noted that "sexual freedom" is a vice frequently attributed to
the conspiracist's target group, noting that "very often the fantasies of true
believers reveal strong sadomasochistic outlets, vividly expressed, for
example, in the delight of anti-Masons with the cruelty of Masonic
punishments".[127]
