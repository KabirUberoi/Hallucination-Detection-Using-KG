The Bertrand competition assumes homogenous products and a constant marginal
cost and players choose the prices.[23] The equilibrium of price competition
is where the price is equal to marginal costs, assuming complete information
about the competitors' costs. Therefore, the firms have an incentive to
deviate from the equilibrium because a homogenous product with a lower price
will gain all of the market share, known as a cost advantage.[156]
