In the case of child-on-child sexual abuse, young children who have not
matured sexually are incapable of knowing about specific sex acts without an
external source.[5][6][7] Consequently, children who initiate or solicit
overtly sexual acts with other children either have been sexually
[victimized](/wiki/Victimized "Victimized") beforehand (by an adult or another
child)[5][6][8] or they have been exposed to sexually explicit material.
Research shows that about one-third to one-half of children with problematic
sexual behaviors have no history of sexual abuse themselves.[9] In many
instances, the perpetrating child has been exposed to pornography or
repeatedly witnessed sexual activity of adults at a very young age, and this
can also be considered a form of [child sexual abuse](/wiki/Child\_sexual\_abuse
"Child sexual abuse").[8]

In many cases, a child or adolescent may have no intent to cause any harm to
another child, and they act merely on a passing impulse. However, this act may
still result in harm to the other child and is a form of child-on-child sexual
abuse.[10] Furthermore, children who had experienced an unwanted sexual
approach may not understand that this act was crime against themselves.[11]
