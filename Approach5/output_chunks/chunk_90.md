## Connections to
mathematics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=String\_theory&action=edit&section=21
"Edit section: Connections to mathematics")]

In addition to influencing research in [theoretical
physics](/wiki/Theoretical\_physics "Theoretical physics"), string theory has
stimulated a number of major developments in [pure
mathematics](/wiki/Pure\_mathematics "Pure mathematics"). Like many developing
ideas in theoretical physics, string theory does not at present have a
[mathematically rigorous](/wiki/Mathematical\_rigor "Mathematical rigor")
formulation in which all of its concepts can be defined precisely. As a
result, physicists who study string theory are often guided by physical
intuition to conjecture relationships between the seemingly different
mathematical structures that are used to formalize different parts of the
theory. These conjectures are later proved by mathematicians, and in this way,
string theory serves as a source of new ideas in pure mathematics.[89]
