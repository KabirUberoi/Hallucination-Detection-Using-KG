Main articles: [Simultaneous game](/wiki/Simultaneous\_game "Simultaneous
game") and [Sequential game](/wiki/Sequential\_game "Sequential game")

[Simultaneous games](/wiki/Simultaneous\_game "Simultaneous game") are games
where both players move simultaneously, or instead the later players are
unaware of the earlier players' actions (making them \_effectively\_
simultaneous). [Sequential games](/wiki/Sequential\_game "Sequential game") (or
dynamic games) are games where players do not make decisions simultaneously,
and player's earlier actions affect the outcome and decisions of other
players.[22] This need not be [perfect information](/wiki/Perfect\_information
"Perfect information") about every action of earlier players; it might be very
little knowledge. For instance, a player may know that an earlier player did
not perform one particular action, while they do not know which of the other
available actions the first player actually performed.

The difference between simultaneous and sequential games is captured in the
different representations discussed above. Often, [normal
form](/wiki/Normal\_form\_game "Normal form game") is used to represent
simultaneous games, while [extensive form](/wiki/Extensive\_form\_game
"Extensive form game") is used to represent sequential ones. The
transformation of extensive to normal form is one way, meaning that multiple
extensive form games correspond to the same normal form. Consequently, notions
of equilibrium for simultaneous games are insufficient for reasoning about
sequential games; see [subgame perfection](/wiki/Subgame\_perfection "Subgame
perfection").

In short, the differences between sequential and simultaneous games are as
follows:

| Sequential | Simultaneous 
---|---|--- 
Normally denoted by | [Decision trees](/wiki/Decision\_tree "Decision tree") | [Payoff matrices](/wiki/Payoff\_matrix "Payoff matrix") 
Prior knowledge 
of opponent's move? | Yes | No 
Time axis? | Yes | No 
Also known as | [Extensive-form game](/wiki/Extensive-form\_game "Extensive-form game")
