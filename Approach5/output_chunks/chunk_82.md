One approach to formulating string theory and studying its properties is
provided by the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT)
correspondence. This is a theoretical result which implies that string theory
is in some cases equivalent to a quantum field theory. In addition to
providing insights into the mathematical structure of string theory, the
AdS/CFT correspondence has shed light on many aspects of quantum field theory
in regimes where traditional calculational techniques are ineffective.[6] The
AdS/CFT correspondence was first proposed by [Juan
Maldacena](/wiki/Juan\_Maldacena "Juan Maldacena") in late 1997.[68] Important
aspects of the correspondence were elaborated in articles by [Steven
Gubser](/wiki/Steven\_Gubser "Steven Gubser"), [Igor
Klebanov](/wiki/Igor\_Klebanov "Igor Klebanov"), and [Alexander Markovich
Polyakov](/wiki/Alexander\_Markovich\_Polyakov "Alexander Markovich
Polyakov"),[69] and by Edward Witten.[70] By 2010, Maldacena's article had
over 7000 citations, becoming the most highly cited article in the field of
[high energy physics](/wiki/High\_energy\_physics "High energy physics").[c]
