The [United States National Academy of
Sciences](/wiki/United\_States\_National\_Academy\_of\_Sciences "United States
National Academy of Sciences") defines scientific theories as follows:

> The formal scientific definition of "theory" is quite different from the
> everyday meaning of the word. It refers to a comprehensive explanation of
> some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence. Many
> scientific theories are so well established that no new evidence is likely
> to alter them substantially. For example, no new evidence will demonstrate
> that the Earth does not orbit around the sun (heliocentric theory), or that
> living things are not made of cells (cell theory), that matter is not
> composed of atoms, or that the surface of the Earth is not divided into
> solid plates that have moved over geological timescales (the theory of plate
> tectonics) ... One of the most useful properties of scientific theories is
> that they can be used to make predictions about natural events or phenomena
> that have not yet been observed.[17]

From the [American Association for the Advancement of
Science](/wiki/American\_Association\_for\_the\_Advancement\_of\_Science "American
Association for the Advancement of Science"):

> A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of
> the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly
> confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories
> are not "guesses" but reliable accounts of the real world. The theory of
> biological evolution is more than "just a theory." It is as factual an
> explanation of the universe as the atomic theory of matter or the germ
> theory of disease. Our understanding of gravity is still a work in progress.
> But the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is an accepted fact.[16]

The term \_theory\_ is not appropriate for describing [scientific
models](/wiki/Scientific\_modelling "Scientific modelling") or untested, but
intricate hypotheses.
