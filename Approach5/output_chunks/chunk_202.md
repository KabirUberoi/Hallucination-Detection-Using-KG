In addition to psychological factors such as conspiracist ideation,
sociological factors also help account for who believes in which conspiracy
theories. Such theories tend to get more traction among election losers in
society, for example, and the emphasis of conspiracy theories by elites and
leaders tends to increase belief among followers who have higher levels of
conspiracy thinking.[140]

[Christopher Hitchens](/wiki/Christopher\_Hitchens "Christopher Hitchens")
described conspiracy theories as the "exhaust fumes of democracy":[128] the
unavoidable result of a large amount of information circulating among a large
number of people.

Conspiracy theories may be emotionally satisfying, by assigning blame to a
group to which the theorist does not belong and so absolving the theorist of
moral or political responsibility in society.[141] Likewise, [Roger
Cohen](/wiki/Roger\_Cohen "Roger Cohen") writing for \_[The New York
Times](/wiki/The\_New\_York\_Times "The New York Times")\_ has said that, "captive
minds; ... resort to conspiracy theory because it is the ultimate refuge of
the powerless. If you cannot change your own life, it must be that some
greater force controls the world."[129]

Sociological historian Holger Herwig found in studying German explanations for
the origins of [World War I](/wiki/World\_War\_I "World War I"), "Those events
that are most important are hardest to understand because they attract the
greatest attention from myth makers and charlatans."[142]

[Justin Fox](/wiki/Justin\_Fox "Justin Fox") of \_[Time](/wiki/Time\_\(magazine\)
"Time \(magazine\)")\_ magazine argues that Wall Street traders are among the
most conspiracy-minded group of people, and ascribes this to the reality of
some financial market conspiracies, and to the ability of conspiracy theories
to provide necessary orientation in the market's day-to-day movements.[124]
