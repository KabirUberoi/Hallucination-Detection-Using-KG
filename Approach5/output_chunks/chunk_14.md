Main article: [Scientific theory](/wiki/Scientific\_theory "Scientific theory")

In science, the term "theory" refers to "a well-substantiated explanation of
some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been
[repeatedly confirmed](/wiki/Reproducibility "Reproducibility") through
[observation](/wiki/Observation "Observation") and experiment."[15][16]
Theories must also meet further requirements, such as the ability to make
[falsifiable](/wiki/Falsifiability "Falsifiability") predictions with
consistent accuracy across a broad area of scientific inquiry, and production
of strong evidence in favor of the theory from multiple independent sources
([consilience](/wiki/Consilience "Consilience")).

The strength of a scientific theory is related to the diversity of phenomena
it can explain, which is measured by its ability to make
[falsifiable](/wiki/Falsifiability "Falsifiability")
[predictions](/wiki/Prediction#Prediction\_in\_science "Prediction") with
respect to those phenomena. Theories are improved (or replaced by better
theories) as more evidence is gathered, so that accuracy in prediction
improves over time; this increased accuracy corresponds to an increase in
scientific knowledge. Scientists use theories as a foundation to gain further
scientific knowledge, as well as to accomplish goals such as inventing
technology or curing diseases.
