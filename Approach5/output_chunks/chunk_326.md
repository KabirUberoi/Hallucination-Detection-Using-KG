In Zulu culture, there is a tradition in which girls of a certain age can
perform a dance for the king. However, only virgins are allowed to
participate.[11] If a girl is tested and declared a virgin, she brings honor
to her family. If a girl is found not to be a virgin, her father may have to
pay a fine for "tainting" the community and the girl may be shunned from the
"certified" virgins.[12] Because of the ramifications that being considered
impure have for the girls and their families, virginity testing has the
potential to be a life-changing event.
