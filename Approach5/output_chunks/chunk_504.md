In his 1638 \_Two New Sciences\_ , Galileo's character
[Salviati](/wiki/Filippo\_Salviati "Filippo Salviati"), widely regarded as
Galileo's spokesman, held that all unequal weights would fall with the same
finite speed in a vacuum. Salviati also held that this could be experimentally
demonstrated by the comparison of pendulum motions in air with bobs of lead
and of cork which had different weights but which were otherwise
similar.[\_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed
