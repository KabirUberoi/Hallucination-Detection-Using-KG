### Bell's theorem and its
implications[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Quantum\_Reality&action=edit&section=4
"Edit section: Bell's theorem and its implications")]

Adding a further wrinkle to the nature of quantum reality, Herbert presents
the [EPR paradox](/wiki/EPR\_paradox "EPR paradox"), and its resolution in the
form of [Bell's theorem](/wiki/Bell%27s\_theorem "Bell's theorem"). The EPR
paradox, resting on the long-held assumption of
[locality](/wiki/Principle\_of\_locality "Principle of locality"), suggests the
existence of "elements of reality"—unmeasured quantum attributes which are
nonetheless real—which are not predicted by quantum theory. Bell's theorem
resolves this paradox by proving that locality is ruled out by
observation—that any model of reality consistent with observation \_must\_ allow
for non-local interaction. However, Herbert is careful to note, Bell's theorem
does not entail any prediction of experimentally observable non-local
\_phenomena\_ , nor does it allow for superluminal communication.[2]: 211–231

Herbert then re-evaluates the aforementioned interpretations of quantum
reality in light of Bell's theorem:

 \* In the case of the Copenhagen interpretation, the "experimental arrangement" of observed entity and measurement device in which quantum attributes reside—considered by Bohr to be limited to the local interaction—must be expanded to include potentially distant objects with which these systems may be entangled.[2]: 240–241
 \* According to Herbert, Bell's theorem supports the Bohmian notion of underlying reality as an undivided wholeness.[2]: 241–242
 \* Although Herbert asserts that the many-worlds interpretation lacks the [counterfactual definiteness](/wiki/Counterfactual\_definiteness "Counterfactual definiteness") required to prove Bell's theorem, he contends that the many-worlds view is inherently non-local, by any reasonable conception of locality.[2]: 242
 \* In Herbert's view, Bell's result strikes a major blow to neorealist models, by showing that the ostensibly real pilot wave must violate Einstein's universal [speed limit](/wiki/Speed\_of\_light "Speed of light").[2]: 243–244

Herbert concludes that, although Bell's theorem does not preclude any of the
aforementioned interpretations of quantum mechanics, it insists that any valid
interpretation \_must\_ allow for non-local interaction.[2]: 245
