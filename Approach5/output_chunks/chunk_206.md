The term "truth seeker" is adopted by some conspiracy theorists when
describing themselves on social media.[152]

Conspiracy theorists are often referred to derogatorily as
"[cookers](/wiki/Cooker\_\(slang\) "Cooker \(slang\)")" in Australia.[153] The
term "cooker" is also loosely associated with the [far right](/wiki/Far-
right\_politics\_in\_Australia "Far-right politics in Australia").[154][155]
