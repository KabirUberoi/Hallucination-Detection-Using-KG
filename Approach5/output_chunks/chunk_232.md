Humanistic psychologist [Abraham Maslow](/wiki/Abraham\_Maslow "Abraham
Maslow"), upon whose work McGregor drew for Theories X and Y, went on to
propose his own model of workplace motivation, [Theory Z](/wiki/Theory\_Z
"Theory Z"). Unlike Theories X and Y, Theory Z recognizes a transcendent
dimension to work and worker motivation. An optimal managerial style would
help cultivate worker creativity, insight, meaning and moral excellence.[11]
