That unequal weights would fall with the same speed may have been proposed as
early as by the Roman philosopher [Lucretius](/wiki/Lucretius
"Lucretius").[200] Observations that similarly sized objects of different
weights fall at the same speed is documented in sixth century works by [John
Philoponus](/wiki/John\_Philoponus "John Philoponus"), which Galileo was aware
of.[201][202] In the 14th century, [Nicole Oresme](/wiki/Nicole\_Oresme "Nicole
Oresme") had derived the time-squared law for uniformly accelerated
change,[203][204] and in the 16th century, [Domingo de
Soto](/wiki/Domingo\_de\_Soto "Domingo de Soto") had suggested that bodies
falling through a homogeneous medium would be uniformly accelerated.[205] De
Soto, however, did not anticipate many of the qualifications and refinements
contained in Galileo's theory of falling bodies. He did not, for instance,
recognise, as Galileo did, that a body would fall with a strictly uniform
acceleration only in a vacuum, and that it would otherwise eventually reach a
uniform terminal velocity.
