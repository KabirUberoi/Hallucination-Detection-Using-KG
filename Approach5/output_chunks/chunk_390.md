Isaac Newton 
(1642–1727)

The late 17th and early 18th centuries saw the achievements of [Cambridge
University](/wiki/Cambridge\_University "Cambridge University") physicist and
mathematician Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727). Newton, a fellow of the [Royal
Society of England](/wiki/Royal\_Society "Royal Society"), combined his own
discoveries in mechanics and astronomy to earlier ones to create a single
system for describing the workings of the universe. Newton formulated three
laws of motion which formulated the relationship between motion and objects
and also the [law of universal
gravitation](/wiki/Newton%27s\_law\_of\_universal\_gravitation "Newton's law of
universal gravitation"), the latter of which could be used to explain the
behavior not only of falling bodies on the earth but also planets and other
celestial bodies. To arrive at his results, Newton invented one form of an
entirely new branch of mathematics: [calculus](/wiki/Calculus "Calculus")
(also invented independently by [Gottfried
Leibniz](/wiki/Gottfried\_Wilhelm\_Leibniz "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz")), which
was to become an essential tool in much of the later development in most
branches of physics. Newton's findings were set forth in his \_[Philosophiæ
Naturalis Principia
Mathematica](/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6\_Naturalis\_Principia\_Mathematica
"Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica")\_ ("Mathematical Principles of
Natural Philosophy"), the publication of which in 1687 marked the beginning of
the modern period of mechanics and astronomy.

Newton was able to refute the Cartesian mechanical tradition that all motions
should be explained with respect to the immediate force exerted by corpuscles.
Using his three laws of motion and law of universal gravitation, Newton
removed the idea that objects followed paths determined by natural shapes and
instead demonstrated that not only regularly observed paths, but all the
future motions of any body could be deduced mathematically based on knowledge
of their existing motion, their [mass](/wiki/Mass "Mass"), and the
[forces](/wiki/Force "Force") acting upon them. However, observed celestial
motions did not precisely conform to a Newtonian treatment, and Newton, who
was also deeply interested in [theology](/wiki/Theology "Theology"), imagined
that God intervened to ensure the continued stability of the solar system.

(1646–1716)

Newton's principles (but not his mathematical treatments) proved controversial
with Continental philosophers, who found his lack of
[metaphysical](/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics") explanation for movement and
gravitation philosophically unacceptable. Beginning around 1700, a bitter rift
opened between the Continental and British philosophical traditions, which
were stoked by heated, ongoing, and viciously personal disputes between the
followers of Newton and Leibniz concerning priority over the analytical
techniques of calculus, which each had developed independently. Initially, the
Cartesian and Leibnizian traditions prevailed on the Continent (leading to the
dominance of the Leibnizian calculus notation everywhere except Britain).
Newton himself remained privately disturbed at the lack of a philosophical
understanding of gravitation while insisting in his writings that none was
necessary to infer its reality. As the 18th century progressed, Continental
natural philosophers increasingly accepted the Newtonians' willingness to
forgo [ontological](/wiki/Ontology "Ontology") metaphysical explanations for
mathematically described motions.[43][44][45]

Newton built the first functioning [reflecting
telescope](/wiki/Reflecting\_telescope "Reflecting telescope")[46] and
developed a theory of color, published in \_[Opticks](/wiki/Opticks "Opticks")\_
, based on the observation that a [prism](/wiki/Triangular\_prism\_\(optics\)
"Triangular prism \(optics\)") decomposes [white
light](/wiki/Electromagnetic\_spectrum#Visible\_radiation\_\(light\)
"Electromagnetic spectrum") into the many colours forming the [visible
spectrum](/wiki/Visible\_spectrum "Visible spectrum"). While Newton explained
light as being composed of tiny particles, a rival theory of light which
explained its behavior in terms of waves was presented in 1690 by Christiaan
Huygens. However, the belief in the mechanistic philosophy coupled with
Newton's reputation meant that the wave theory saw relatively little support
until the 19th century. Newton also formulated [an empirical law of
cooling](/wiki/Newton%27s\_law\_of\_cooling "Newton's law of cooling"), studied
the [speed of sound](/wiki/Speed\_of\_sound "Speed of sound"), investigated
[power series](/wiki/Power\_series "Power series"), demonstrated the
[generalised binomial theorem](/wiki/Binomial\_theorem "Binomial theorem") and
developed [a method](/wiki/Newton%27s\_method "Newton's method") for
approximating the [roots of a function](/wiki/Root\_of\_a\_function "Root of a
function"). His work on infinite series was inspired by [Simon
Stevin](/wiki/Simon\_Stevin "Simon Stevin")'s decimals.[47] Most importantly,
Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are
governed by the same set of natural laws, which were neither capricious nor
malevolent. By demonstrating the consistency between [Kepler's laws of
planetary motion](/wiki/Kepler%27s\_laws\_of\_planetary\_motion "Kepler's laws of
planetary motion") and his own theory of gravitation, Newton also removed the
last doubts about heliocentrism. By bringing together all the ideas set forth
during the Scientific Revolution, Newton effectively established the
foundation for modern society in mathematics and science.
