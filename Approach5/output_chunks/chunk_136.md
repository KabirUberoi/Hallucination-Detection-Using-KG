Some scholars see game theory not as a predictive tool for the behavior of
human beings, but as a suggestion for how people ought to behave. Since a
strategy, corresponding to a Nash equilibrium of a game constitutes one's
[best response](/wiki/Best\_response "Best response") to the actions of the
other players – provided they are in (the same) Nash equilibrium – playing a
strategy that is part of a Nash equilibrium seems appropriate. This normative
use of game theory has also come under criticism.[75]
