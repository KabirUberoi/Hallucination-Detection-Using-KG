A theory is \_underdetermined\_ (also called \_indeterminacy of data to theory\_)
if a rival, inconsistent theory is at least as consistent with the evidence.
Underdetermination is an [epistemological](/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology")
issue about the relation of [evidence](/wiki/Evidence "Evidence") to
conclusions.[\_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed
"Wikipedia:Citation needed")\_]

A theory that lacks supporting evidence is generally, more properly, referred
to as a [hypothesis](/wiki/Hypothesis "Hypothesis").[12]
