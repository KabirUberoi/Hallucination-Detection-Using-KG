Einstein deemed that all [fundamental
interactions](/wiki/Fundamental\_interaction "Fundamental interaction") in
nature can be explained in a single theory. Unified field theories were
numerous attempts to "merge" several interactions. One of many formulations of
such theories (as well as field theories in general) is a \_[gauge
theory](/wiki/Gauge\_theory "Gauge theory")\_ , a generalization of the idea of
symmetry. Eventually the [Standard Model](/wiki/Standard\_Model "Standard
Model") (see below) succeeded in unification of strong, weak, and
electromagnetic interactions. All attempts to unify
[gravitation](/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation") with something else failed.
