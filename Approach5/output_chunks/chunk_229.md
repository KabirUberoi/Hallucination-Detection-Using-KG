"Edit section: McGregor and Maslow")]

McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y and [Maslow's hierarchy of
needs](/wiki/Maslow%27s\_hierarchy\_of\_needs "Maslow's hierarchy of needs") are
both rooted in [motivation](/wiki/Motivation "Motivation") theory.[3] Maslow's
hierarchy of needs consists of physiological needs (lowest level), safety
needs, love needs, esteem needs, and [self-actualization](/wiki/Self-
actualization "Self-actualization") (highest level).[3] According to Maslow, a
human is motivated by the level they have not yet reached, and self-
actualization cannot be met until each of the lower levels has been
fulfilled.[4] Assumptions of Theory Y, in relation to Maslow's hierarchy put
an emphasis on employee higher level needs, such as esteem needs and self-
actualization.[4]

McGregor also believed that self-actualization was the highest level of reward
for employees.[4] He theorized that the motivation employees use to reach
self-actualization allows them to reach their full potential.[4] This led
companies to focus on how their employees were motivated, managed, and led,
creating a Theory Y management style which focuses on the drive for individual
self-fulfillment.[4] McGregor's perspective places the responsibility for
performance on managers as well as subordinates.[5]
