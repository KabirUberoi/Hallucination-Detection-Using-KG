Based only on uncertain descriptions of the first practical telescope which
[Hans Lippershey](/wiki/Hans\_Lippershey "Hans Lippershey") tried to patent in
the Netherlands in 1608,[42] Galileo, in the following year, made a telescope
with about 3x magnification. He later made improved versions with up to about
30x magnification.[43] With a [Galilean telescope](/wiki/Galilean\_telescope
"Galilean telescope"), the observer could see magnified, upright images on the
Earthâ€”it was what is commonly known as a terrestrial telescope or a spyglass.
He could also use it to observe the sky; for a time he was one of those who
could construct telescopes good enough for that purpose. On 25 August 1609, he
demonstrated one of his early telescopes, with a magnification of about 8 or
9, to [Venetian](/wiki/Venice "Venice") lawmakers. His telescopes were also a
profitable sideline for Galileo, who sold them to merchants who found them
useful both at sea and as items of trade. He published his initial telescopic
astronomical observations in March 1610 in a brief [treatise](/wiki/Treatise
"Treatise") entitled \_[Sidereus Nuncius](/wiki/Sidereus\_Nuncius "Sidereus
Nuncius")\_ (\_Starry Messenger\_).[44]
