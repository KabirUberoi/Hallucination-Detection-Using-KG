### Discrete and continuous
games[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Game\_theory&action=edit&section=14 "Edit
section: Discrete and continuous games")]

Much of game theory is concerned with finite, discrete games that have a
finite number of players, moves, events, outcomes, etc. Many concepts can be
extended, however. [Continuous games](/wiki/Continuous\_game "Continuous game")
allow players to choose a strategy from a continuous strategy set. For
instance, [Cournot competition](/wiki/Cournot\_competition "Cournot
competition") is typically modeled with players' strategies being any non-
negative quantities, including fractional quantities.
