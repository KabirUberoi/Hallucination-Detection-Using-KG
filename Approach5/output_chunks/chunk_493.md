Galileo made a number of contributions to what is now known as
[engineering](/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), as distinct from pure
[physics](/wiki/Physics "Physics"). Between 1595 and 1598, Galileo devised and
improved a [geometric and military compass](/wiki/Sector\_\(instrument\)
"Sector \(instrument\)") suitable for use by [gunners](/wiki/Artillery
"Artillery") and [surveyors](/wiki/Surveying "Surveying"). This expanded on
earlier instruments designed by [Niccolò
Tartaglia](/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2\_Tartaglia "Niccolò Tartaglia") and [Guidobaldo
del Monte](/wiki/Guidobaldo\_del\_Monte "Guidobaldo del Monte"). For gunners, it
offered, in addition to a new and safer way of elevating
[cannons](/wiki/Cannon "Cannon") accurately, a way of quickly computing the
charge of [gunpowder](/wiki/Gunpowder "Gunpowder") for
[cannonballs](/wiki/Round\_shot "Round shot") of different sizes and materials.
As a geometric instrument, it enabled the construction of any regular
[polygon](/wiki/Polygon "Polygon"), computation of the area of any polygon or
circular sector, and a variety of other calculations. Under Galileo's
direction, instrument maker [Marc'Antonio
Mazzoleni](/wiki/Marc%27Antonio\_Mazzoleni "Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni") produced
more than 100 of these compasses, which Galileo sold (along with an
instruction manual he wrote) for 50 \_lire\_ and offered a course of instruction
in the use of the compasses for 120 \_lire\_.[182]

\(instrument\)"), thought to have been made c. 1604 by his personal
instrument-maker [Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni](/wiki/Marc%27Antonio\_Mazzoleni
"Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni")

In [1593](/wiki/Timeline\_of\_temperature\_and\_pressure\_measurement\_technology
"Timeline of temperature and pressure measurement technology"), Galileo
constructed a [thermometer](/wiki/Galileo\_thermometer "Galileo thermometer"),
using the expansion and contraction of air in a bulb to move water in an
attached tube.[\_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed
"Wikipedia:Citation needed")\_]

In 1609, Galileo was, along with Englishman [Thomas
Harriot](/wiki/Thomas\_Harriot "Thomas Harriot") and others, among the first to
use a refracting telescope as an instrument to observe stars, planets or
moons. The name "telescope" was coined for Galileo's instrument by a Greek
mathematician, [Giovanni Demisiani](/wiki/Giovanni\_Demisiani "Giovanni
Demisiani"),[183][184] at a banquet held in 1611 by Prince [Federico
Cesi](/wiki/Federico\_Cesi "Federico Cesi") to make Galileo a member of his
[Accademia dei Lincei](/wiki/Accademia\_dei\_Lincei "Accademia dei
Lincei").[185] In 1610, he used a telescope at close range to magnify the
parts of insects.[186][187] By 1624, Galileo had used a compound
[microscope](/wiki/Microscope "Microscope"). He gave one of these instruments
to Cardinal Zollern in May of that year for presentation to the Duke of
Bavaria,[188] and in September, he sent another to Prince Cesi.[189] The
[Linceans](/wiki/Accademia\_dei\_Lincei "Accademia dei Lincei") played a role
again in naming the "microscope" a year later when fellow academy member
[Giovanni Faber](/wiki/Giovanni\_Faber "Giovanni Faber") coined the word for
Galileo's invention from the Greek words \_μικρόν\_ (\_micron\_) meaning "small",
and \_σκοπεῖν\_ (\_skopein\_) meaning "to look at". The word was meant to be
analogous with "telescope".[190][191] Illustrations of insects made using one
of Galileo's microscopes and published in 1625, appear to have been the first
clear documentation of the [use of a compound
microscope](/wiki/Timeline\_of\_microscope\_technology "Timeline of microscope
technology").[189]

earliest known pendulum clock design, conceived by Galileo Galilei

In 1612, having determined the orbital periods of Jupiter's satellites,
Galileo proposed that with sufficiently accurate knowledge of their orbits,
one could use their positions as a universal clock, and this would make
possible the determination of [longitude](/wiki/Longitude "Longitude"). He
worked on this problem from time to time during the remainder of his life, but
the practical problems were severe. The method was first successfully applied
by [Giovanni Domenico Cassini](/wiki/Giovanni\_Domenico\_Cassini "Giovanni
Domenico Cassini") in 1681 and was later used extensively for large land
surveys; this method, for example, was used to survey France, and later by
[Zebulon Pike](/wiki/Zebulon\_Pike "Zebulon Pike") of the midwestern United
States in 1806. For sea navigation, where delicate telescopic observations
were more difficult, the longitude problem eventually required the development
of a practical portable [marine chronometer](/wiki/Marine\_chronometer "Marine
chronometer"), such as that of [John Harrison](/wiki/John\_Harrison "John
Harrison").[192] Late in his life, when totally blind, Galileo designed an
[escapement](/wiki/Escapement "Escapement") mechanism for a pendulum clock
(called [Galileo's escapement](/wiki/Galileo%27s\_escapement "Galileo's
escapement")), although no clock using this was built until after the first
fully operational pendulum clock was made by [Christiaan
Huygens](/wiki/Christiaan\_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens") in the
1650s.[\_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation
needed")\_]

Galileo was invited on several occasions to advise on engineering schemes to
alleviate river flooding. In 1630 Mario Guiducci was probably instrumental in
ensuring that he was consulted on a [scheme by
Bartolotti](/wiki/Mario\_Guiducci#Hydrology\_of\_the\_Bisenzio\_River "Mario
Guiducci") to cut a new channel for the [Bisenzio
River](/wiki/Bisenzio\_\(river\) "Bisenzio \(river\)") near Florence.[193]

An issue with simple [ball bearings](/wiki/Ball\_bearing "Ball bearing") is
that the balls rub against each other, causing additional friction. This can
be reduced by enclosing each individual ball within a cage. The captured, or
caged, ball bearing was originally described by Galileo in the 17th
century.[194]
