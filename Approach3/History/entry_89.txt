%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%GROUND_TRUTH%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Ground Truth : 

Adamu ɓii Ardo Hassana (c. 1771 c. 1848), more commonly known as Modibo Adamu, was a Fulani scholar and holy warrior who hailed from the Ba'en clan of Fulbe.
He led a jihad into the region of Fumbina (in modern-day Cameroon and Nigeria), opening the region for Fulani colonisation.
As a result of Adamu's constant warring, the Fulani today make up the largest ethnic group in northern Cameroon (at more than 60 of the region's entire population, which, considering the fact that they weren't from the area, is a remarkable feat), and Islam is the dominant religion.
The wars also forced many peoples south into the forest region.
Adamu studied in Hausaland and earned the title "Modibo" ("Lettered One") for his scholarship.
Upon finishing his studies, he returned home to Gurin and learned of the jihad declared by Fulani mystic Usman dan Fodio.
When he accompanied a delegation to visit Usman, the leader ordered Adamu to extend his jihad east as "Lamido Fumbina" (Ruler of the Southlands).
Adamu raised an army and attacked Bata settlements near Gurin.
He took the villages, and many more traditional Fulbe leaders and new soldiers came to his side.
He next took on Mandara, the largest and best organised state in the region.
He swept over several smaller settlements and eventually conquered the Mandara capital, Dulo, with ease.
While his men celebrated, however, the Mandara army counterattacked and recaptured the town.
Though he fought many more campaigns, Adamu now spent most of his time in Yola, which became his capital.
He set about creating the administrative structure of his new state, which he named Adamawa after himself.
Adamu ruled the empire, subordinate only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto.
Below him lay the heads of major settlements, known as Lamibe (singular Lamido).
The village formed the smallest unit of government.
Upon Adamu's death in 1847, his son Muhammadu Lawal became Lamido of Adamawa.
The empire was not to last, however, as colonial battles and division eventually destroyed the independent Fulani state.
The conquest had long-term repercussions, however.
The Fulani became the dominant ethnic group in the region, and Islam the major religion.
The herdsmen altered the land to be more suitable for herding cattle, their primary pursuit.
The jihad also pushed those peoples who had lived on the Adamawa Plateau south into the forest, the single most important event in the populating of southern Cameroon.
