Through the use of his [vanity cards](/wiki/Production\_logo "Production logo")
at the end of episodes, Lorre alleged that the program had been
[plagiarized](/wiki/Plagiarism "Plagiarism") by a show produced and aired in
[Belarus](/wiki/Belarus "Belarus") in 2010.[222] Officially titled
\_[Теоретики](/wiki/%D0%A2%D0%B5%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8

"ru:Теоретики")]\_ (\_The Theorists\_), the show features "clones" of the main
characters, a similar opening sequence, and what appears to be a very close
Russian translation of the scripts.[223] Lorre expressed annoyance and
described his inquiry with the Warner Bros. legal department about options.
The television production company and station's close relationship with the
Belarus government was cited as the reason that any attempt to claim copyright
infringement would be in vain because the company copying the episodes is
operated by the government.[224]

However, no legal action was required to end production of the other show: as
soon as it became known that the show was unlicensed, the actors quit and the
producers canceled it.[225] [Dmitriy
